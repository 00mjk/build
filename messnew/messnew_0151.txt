Source Changes
--------------

-updated Acron A3010 roms labels and added battery management program
 rom [robcfg]

-a7800.c - Cleanup of address maps, high score maps added [Robert Tuccitto]

 vram handler due to bus width differece. Hook up VIAs to swyft.
 Further work on documenting the rom and ram layout of the swyft,
 pending hardware tests to figure out the via hookups.
 [Lord Nightmare, Dwight Elvey, Sandy Bumgarner]

 keyboard fix [shattered]

-RSP SIMD changes: [MooglyGuy, Marathon Man]
 * Converted high and middle accumulator slices into SIMD vectors.
 * Converted flag registers into SIMD vectors.
 * Fixed unaligned accesses in CFC2 opcode.
 * Added SCALAR_GET_VS1, SCALAR_GET_VS2, and SET_ACCUM_H/M/L to act as
    a passthrough to either the non-SIMD implementation or individual
    element insert/extract ops in order to minimize #if USE_SIMD all
    over the place.
 * Ported SIMD implementations of VMUDL, VMUDM, VMUDN, VMUDH, VMACF,
    VMACU, VMADL, VMADM, VMADN, and VMADH from CEN64 with permission
 * Resulted in an overall speedup of approximately 50% for RSP-bound
   scenes on a 2.5GHz i5.

-apogee: sound support [shattered]

-Refactored N64 RDP blender to use function arrays in order to [MooglyGuy] 
 flatten inner-loop branch structures for potential  performance.

 functional differences between RDP modes more apparent.

-N64 RDP and RSP improvements [MooglyGuy, Marathon Man]
 * Fixed an RSP DMA edge case when transfer count is greater than 1.
 * Refactored the RDP blender implementation to use function pointers
    rather than deep if/else structures in order to reduce branch
    prediction penalties in the inner software rasterizer loop.
 * Reduced the likelihood that bad triangle commands due to an RSP
   crash will crash MESS.

-N64 optimizations: [MooglyGuy]
 * Converted PIF RAM from 8-bit array to 32-bit array
 * Inlined color and alpha combiner equations
 * Moved a number of calculations in span rendering to outer loops
 * Flattened branch structure of texel fetching somewhat

 -409/-410 dsp firmware works correctly; some minor documentation
 updates as well, and added a compile-time feature to boost interleave
 when the output fifo is about to run out. [Lord Nightmare]

-dectalk.c: fixed 68k->dsp fifo, hooked up the old 1.8 dsp rom
