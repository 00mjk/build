-vidbrain: Added expansion port pinout. (nw)

-llc: modernised ; LLC2 added support for reverse video & added missing
 pio. [Robbbert]

-vk100: Some improvement to the HLE vector generator, now properly
 emulates the down counter so the "blue screen" part of the POST looks
 correct, as does the cursor width. [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: broke the vram access logic/math out of the vector generator
 callback and into its own functions; fixed? the systat_a register to
 read the vram nybble the x and y regs are currently pointing to.
 [Lord Nightmare]

-socrates: document that an MCU dump is missing of the 4-bit TMP42C40P
 that decodes the IR signal from the keyboard and buffers the 'second
 stage' of the keyboard input. Changed code slightly to reflect this.
 [Lord Nightmare, Balrog]

-z9001 : added 2xpio, ctc, daisy-chain, beeper-sound, cassout
 [Robbbert]

-v6809 : various video improvements. [Robbbert]

-abc80: Refactored legacy code, moved DOS ROMs to ABC bus DOS card,

 added RTS callback which doesn't seem to work yet. [Lord Nightmare]

 using the vt125 schematics as a guide, figured out what all the vector
 rom pins do (except perhaps D LOAD). [Lord Nightmare]

 [Lord Nightmare, Al Kossow]

-sbc6510: Connected up the keyboard and added ay-3-8910 chip [Robbbert]

 Professional-DOS V1 hardware. [Curt Coder]

System Driver Changes:

-vt100: Fix vt100 to use beep instead of speaker. Some work still needs to be
 done to beep.c since the phase needs to be reset in such a way that
 keyclicks work consistently, in addition to beeps. [Lord Nightmare]

-vt100: Added missing dot stretching to the DEC VT100's dc012 emulation. See
 EK-VT100-TM-003 page 4-76 for a description. Note the stretching takes
 place after the character rom but before invert or other attributes.
 [Lord Nightmare]

 layout for LEDS, beginning of skeleton keyboard support.
 [Lord Nightmare]

 SYSTAT_A commented for now since its behavior is unclear. Added and
 attached the dipswitches to SYSTAT_B (though this may well be wrong)
 Hooked up the i8251 uart preliminarily (ints not hooked up yet)
 [Lord Nightmare]

-mc1502: added cassette input, keyboard input fix. [shattered]

-iskr1031, ec1841: split machine descriptions from pc16, remove hacks

 for remapping banks inside the board.  Memory test in POST passes.
 [shattered]

-vk100: WIP: preliminary gfx rendering; hooked up the i8251 interrupts.
 Corrected dipswitch locations. [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: Initial implementation of the vector generator. Rather buggy, and not
 really readable yet, but it definitely shows something on screen, and
 you can type and see things change! (and you see a blinking cursor
 too!) [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: further improvements to the vector generator, still not
 completely correct. [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: FINALLY fixed the vector generator. Display looks relatively
 sane now. Fixed shift and capslock being reversed and added
 port_toggle to capslock. [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: preliminary direction support for basic vectors. doesn't quite
 work right yet. [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: Add more debugging defines, remove some unneeded code, and
 added more comments to TODO and to some registers. [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: vector generator uses "real" timing instead of drawing the
 vector instantly. [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: update comments to reflect that the pr1 prom is clearly the
 VECTOR ROM. Add notes about what each address bit does or is thought
 to do. (the tech manual documentation is lousy, but is better than
 nothing). [Lord Nightmare]

-geniusiq: Added PCB layout for the German Version. [TeamEurope]

-vk100: minor cleanups to variable names, documented as much of the
 address info of the sync and direction proms as I could figure so far.
 [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: vector timing callback rate is now definitely correct; the tech
 manual had an annoying error which made this hard to figure out.
 [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: figured out bits 3,2,1 of SOPS register and implemented
 blinking and documented serial multiplexer based on these findings.
 Also fixed a stupid bug in the display code which broke the reverse
 video bit. [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: properly hooked up dipswitches through the SYSTAT_A register
 bit d2. Got rid of some dead palette code. [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: Fixed the weird ordering of the dipswitches, so everything now
 controls what it should. [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: Add the two previously-missing PROMs (not hooked up yet);
 Update notes a bit, correct location for the main roms according to
 tech manual (it turns out you count from the lower right corner
 upward, not upper right downward). [Lord Nightmare, Balrog, Andy V.]

-vk100: Comment wrangling and some analysis of the newly dumped proms.
 Still some work to be done here especially on the vector prom.
 [Lord Nightmare]

 * Identified monitor keys
 * Turns out new monitor rom is also a bad dump
 * Added patches to make the system usable

-vk100: more comment updates based on shared info from VT125 tech
 manual [Lord Nightmare]

-vk100: slight documentation updates, traced sync rom A4 completely.

 hardware. Note the intv1 exec.bin still needs to be split to the two
 separate roms that the real hardware used. [Lord Nightmare]

 no commercial carts used this afaik, at least one homebrew cart does
 and won't work without it. (actually this was in the previous commit
 by accident) Corrected the manufacturer/name of the Sears Super Video
 Arcade. [Lord Nightmare]

-thomson: Performance improvements and bug-fixes: more efficient bank

-vip: Connected the byte I/O and expansion ports. Refactored the
 VP550, VP590, and VP595 to implement the expansion slot interface.
 [Curt Coder]

-vip: Added beeper on/off switch, and VP585 board. [Curt Coder]

-ti99: gromport redesigned, now offering three slot options "single"
 (default) / "multi" / "gkracker" determining the set of cartridge
 slots (cart or cart1/2/3/4). Cartridge insertion may be set to trigger
 RESET or not. TI consoles now have a dedicated RESET line, connected
 to the RESET input of the CPU and VDP. [Michael Zapf]

-DEC VK100/GIGI documentation update; document two missing proms,
 correct (I hope) IC locations (until we can get schematics) using the
 DEC system of counting from the top right corner downward and shifting
 one column to the left at the end, and documented the (sometimes
 barely/illegible) markings on the proms.

-upd765.c: Trigger RDY active during reset interrupt for each drive
 independently so that 4 consecutive Sense Interrupt commands will
 return the correct status. [Curt Coder]

-SoundBlaster: first-pass somewhat naive working version.  Autoinit DMA
 does not work; use sblaster1_0, not 1_5!  [R. Belmont]

-New TMS9900 and TMS9995 implementation with proper control line
 handling and wait state generation. Previous implementation has been
 renamed and drivers point to the old implementation until they are
 adapted to the new one. [Michael Zapf]
