 * Special handling for data polling before a write has completed.
 * Allow optional configuration of device to lock EEPROM after each write, as often used by Atari.
 * Eliminate the Atari EEPROM interface devices, since their special features have been incorporated into the base device. To

-dblewing: Modernize soundlatch; improve IRQ arbitration for (hopefully) less dropped sound commands [AJR]

-cninjabl2: Fix sound banking [AJR]

-tnzs.cpp: Add correct color proms for Chuka Taisen (Japan) (P0-025-A PCB) [Pacman70]

-grchamp.cpp: Fixed the sound latch system such that the bit 7 clearing actually works, and properly synchronized the sound latch
 writes and bit 7 clears. Added memory map comment for sound cpu. Added missing sound nmi enable, and hooked sound nmi to the sound
 semaphore. Added sound semaphore readback. [Lord Nightmare]

-z8: Make data space optional; fix stack pop semantics [AJR]

-upd7725: dpl bits of the instruction field are ignored if dp is the destination register of the current opcode. similarly, rpdcr
 bit is ignored if rp is the destination register of the current opcode. [Jonas Quinn]

-luaengine: translation support [Carl]

-z8: Fix C flag polarity for CP, SBC, SUB and actually subtract with carry in SBC [AJR]
 * This lets amerihok pass its initial checksum calculation.

-z8: Interrupts are working now [AJR]

-tnzs.cpp: Corrected rom PCB locations and added Guru-Readme for the P0-25-A PCB. [Guru]

 * validate will now report an error if no matches occur [Nathan Woods]

-Added a natural keyboard validation to check for valid natural keyboard (uni)codes (#2618) [npwoods]

-mpu401: fix rom name, add full label and version note. [Lord Nightmare]

-megaplay: Make start buttons work properly through BIOS [AJR]

-superqix.cpp: Correctly implemented 8751 port2 latch based on pcb tracing. Fixed semaphores implementation to match pcb tracing.
 Got rid of z80<->mcu 'pending' communication hacks by using synchronize calls. Moved superqix specific variables and member
 functions to its own subclass. Consolidated the 8031 bootleg and 8751 protected set port2 handling code. Removed some unnecessary
 trampoline functions. [Lord Nightmare]

-superqix: added a sync trampoline for reading the semaphores via the ay-3-8910 #1, MCFG_QUANTUM_PERFECT is no longer needed.

 speed and synchronize fences. Added emulation of the 8031 bootleg mcu port 3 output latch. [Lord Nightmare]

-Changing switch statement in ioport_field::key_name() to MAME favored formatting [Nathan Woods]

-COP400 overhaul [AJR]
 * Rewrite the execution control logic to fetch each byte of an instruction separately in one pass of the main loop. This provides
    EEPROM-compatible timing for the SIO shift register, allowing the 93C46 on quizpun2 to be read and written properly (though its
    default contents are a bad dump).
 * Add M pseudo-register (internal RAM referenced by B) to debugger state.
 * Add T register to debugger state on devices where it only affects SKT.
 * The SIO state is now displayed in binary when it is defined as a shift register.
 * Skipped instructions and the SKIP flag can be debugged by compile-time switch (disabled by default).

 [Lord Nightmare]

-hiscore.dat: Updates [Leezer]

-notetaker.cpp: add the disk data separator state machine prom, based on the source listing [Lord Nightmare]

-Attempted to sanitize/rationalize how we access UTF-8 command line arguments (#2532) [npwoods]
 * Specifically, this creates a call osd_get_command_line() that returns UTF-8 command line arguments as std::vector<std::string>.
    On non-Windows platforms, this does nothing more than build the vector.  On Windows, this invokes GetCommandLineW() and
    CommandLineToArgvW().  This also attempts to unwind usage of wmain()/_tmain() on Windows, which is not standard.
 * Related to this, this fixes a bug in Imgtool; specifically, non-7 bit ASCII was not being handled correctly in Windows.
 * This is really an admission that the way that Windows handles Unicode and command line arguments sucks, and it is my belief that
    having a wmain() or _tmain() declaration specific for Windows is a worse solution.  C'est la vie.
 * I'm very open to the idea that src/osd/osdcore.[cpp|h] is not the best place to do this.  Let me know if I should move it.

-rs232: Add 9615 baud rate actually used by a number of systems [AJR]

-Changing switch statement in ioport_field::key_name() to MAME favored formatting [npwoods]

-luaengine: translation support [Carl] Making a pull request for comment about whether this is wanted and if so how to add to
 workflow.  Seems to work fine with find with xgettext anyhow. [cracyc]

-Added a natural keyboard validation to check for valid natural keyboard (uni)codes I had to shuffle the SHIFT_COUNT/SHIFT_STATE
 enums around, and I also moved the "char casting" hack.  Vas might have opinions on how this was done. [npwoods]

-Returning a reference from various corestr.cpp calls to avoid unnecessary string copies [npwoods]

-Attempted to sanitize/rationalize how we access UTF-8 command line arguments Specifically, this creates a call
 osd_get_command_line() that returns UTF-8 command line arguments as std::vector<std::string>.  On non-Windows platforms, this does
