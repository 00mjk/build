    and use the TEAC FD-55F drive instead of the generic one.
 * This is some basic first work to better model the real hardware and floppy drive setups in the future.

-add and use INS8250 register defines (#2601) [Sven Schnelle]
 * replace LSR bits by defines
 * replace MCR by bit defines
 * replace LCR by bit defines

-cninjabl2: Fix sound banking [AJR]

-add apple2_cass softlist (#2605) [Dagarman]
 * Create apple2_cass softlist

-tnzs.cpp: Add correct color proms for Chuka Taisen (Japan) (P0-025-A PCB) [Pacman70]

-grchamp.cpp: Fixed the sound latch system such that the bit 7 clearing actually works, and properly synchronized the sound latch
 writes and bit 7 clears. Added memory map comment for sound cpu. Added missing sound nmi enable, and hooked sound nmi to the sound
 semaphore. Added sound semaphore readback. [Lord Nightmare]

 semaphore. Use input_merge for both nmi enable and the secondary semaphore. Added sound cpu mirroring. [Lord Nightmare]

 * arm7: Various changes: [Ryan Holtz]
   - Added ARM946ES variant.
   - Fixed up CPU ID values.

 * nds: Skeleton driver. [Ryan Holtz]

-Returning a reference from various corestr.cpp calls to avoid unnecessary string copies (#2613) [npwoods]

-upd7725: update ov1 and s1 flag calculation to be correct based on AWJ's nesdev forums post and the original datasheets.
 [AWJ, Lord Nightmare]

-segasp.cpp: dumped origin CF card of "Dinosaur King - Operation: Dinosaur Rescue" [Hellfromabove]

-z8: Make data space optional; fix stack pop semantics [AJR]

-upd7725: dpl bits of the instruction field are ignored if dp is the destination register of the current opcode. similarly, rpdcr
 bit is ignored if rp is the destination register of the current opcode. [Jonas Quinn]

-z8: Mask addresses for external memory accesses based on P0 control bits [AJR]

-HP HIL: passthrough commands between devices [Sven Schnelle]
 * The old code didn't loopback commands that are sent to a non-existing HIL address. Unfortunately the HP 9000/300 Boot ROM does
    that: it send a IDD command to every possible address and fails if it's not looped back.
 * This also changes the API. HIL devices are now able to return true if the command should be passed on to the next devices, or
    false it it shouldn't. This is required for initial configuration of the Bus and various other commands like POLL, which are
    sent to the global address.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-HP9000/300: Add HIL keyboard support [Sven Schnelle]
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-HP9000/300: fix detection of DIO cards [Sven Schnelle]
 * Install a buserror handler for the DIO/DIO-II card ranges. The 300 BOOT ROM expects to get a Buserror signal to detect if there's
    a card. Also remove that memory of PC's doing invalid Bus accesses as this breaks this detection.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-HP9000/300: disable DMA controller workaround [Sven Schnelle]
 * Faking the DMA register set with RAM makes the 'Failed' message go away, but makes the ROM use DMA functionality even if there's
    none. Seen this while working on HPIB support which tries to transfer data via DMA and fails. When disabling the DMA hack the
    ROM falls back to PIO mode.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-luaengine: translation support [Carl]

 * have now tested 82586 version successfully
 * include heartbeat indicator on all transmits to pass InterPro diagnostic
 * also corrected a bug affecting long frames - now allows up to 64k, slightly worried about the increase in save state, but don't
    have a better idea

-clipper: interrupt handling fixes [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * improve interrupt vector handling
 * fix C300 interrupt entry and stack frame
 * fix pushw where source register is same as stack register
 * switch to logmacro.h logging

-hp9k_3xx: hook up keyboard/sound to HP9000/332 (#2630) [Sven Schnelle]
 * HP9000/300: Add SN76494 sound device
 * hp9k_3xx: hook up keyboard/sound to HP9000/332

-hp9k_3xx: add 98603 ROM card [Sven Schnelle]
 * Even if BASIC doesn't boot yet it's handy to have the ROM card in the code and BASIC in the software list.

-mpu401: fix rom name, add full label and version note. [Lord Nightmare]

-demote Megaplay to not working, see notes [David Haywood]

-megaplay: Make start buttons work properly through BIOS [AJR]

-68340: Fixed -validate errors and made slight cleanup [Joakim Larsson Edstrom]

-superqix.cpp: Correctly implemented 8751 port2 latch based on pcb tracing. Fixed semaphores implementation to match pcb tracing.
 Got rid of z80<->mcu 'pending' communication hacks by using synchronize calls. Moved superqix specific variables and member
 functions to its own subclass. Consolidated the 8031 bootleg and 8751 protected set port2 handling code. Removed some unnecessary
 trampoline functions. [Lord Nightmare]

-superqix: added a sync trampoline for reading the semaphores via the ay-3-8910 #1, MCFG_QUANTUM_PERFECT is no longer needed.
 [Lord Nightmare]

-hp16500: connect HIL MLC [Sven Schnelle]
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-68340: simplified code by making the timer module implementation a device and created two independent instanses, as it should be

-new working machine promoted from non-working [briantro]

-quizpun2: Emulate COP402 MCU [AJR]

-superqix: Traced out correct clock divider for cpu and mcu from pcb. Fixed issue with sqixb1 not working with the correct clock
 speed and synchronize fences. Added emulation of the 8031 bootleg mcu port 3 output latch. [Lord Nightmare]

 [Joakim Larsson Edstrom, Joel Tegner]

-Changing switch statement in ioport_field::key_name() to MAME favored formatting [Nathan Woods]

-demote Panic Road (panicr) to MACHINE_NOT_WORKING playtesting shows that the collisions aren't right, broken collisions = broken
 game logic = MACHINE_NOT_WORKING flag, we have higher standards. [David Haywood]

-COP400 overhaul [AJR]
 * Rewrite the execution control logic to fetch each byte of an instruction separately in one pass of the main loop. This provides
    EEPROM-compatible timing for the SIO shift register, allowing the 93C46 on quizpun2 to be read and written properly (though its
    default contents are a bad dump).
 * Add M pseudo-register (internal RAM referenced by B) to debugger state.
 * Add T register to debugger state on devices where it only affects SKT.
 * The SIO state is now displayed in binary when it is defined as a shift register.
 * Skipped instructions and the SKIP flag can be debugged by compile-time switch (disabled by default).

-fix corrupt bytes in two mc68705 dumps after re-analysis of raw dump data.  [Lord Nightmare, ShouTime]

-apple2e: don't update 80-col screen immediately on page switch [Peter Ferrie]

-upd765: sense interrupt status and i82072 changes (#2632) [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * Yet another attempt at implementing the i82072 sense interrupt status logic. This time, I've separated the logic into the derived
    class, so it won't affect the other devices. Also included motor on/off logic (unique to i82072) - motor on delay is incomplete.

-iteagle: Set medium resolution as default for virtpool and remove MACHINE_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS. [Ted Green]

-New device: Data East IRQ Controller [Dirk Best]
 * Used by games in the cninja and deco32 drivers. This implies proper VBlank IRQ ack for all games now. Also added and improved raw
    screen parameters for various games.

-Fix retofinvb3 colors [Lord Nightmare]

-m68k: fix abcd/sbcd/nbcd to pass 68k-bcd-verifier [notaz]
 * Flamewing has a test that claims to exhaustively test BCD instructions: https://github.com/flamewing/68k-bcd-verifier I've
    verified the test indeed passes on my Megadrive model1 (68000).

-Added basic stub layout with drive LEDs [rfka01]

-Attempted to sanitize/rationalize how we access UTF-8 command line arguments (#2532) [npwoods]
 * Specifically, this creates a call osd_get_command_line() that returns UTF-8 command line arguments as std::vector<std::string>.
    On non-Windows platforms, this does nothing more than build the vector.  On Windows, this invokes GetCommandLineW() and
    CommandLineToArgvW().  This also attempts to unwind usage of wmain()/_tmain() on Windows, which is not standard.
 * Related to this, this fixes a bug in Imgtool; specifically, non-7 bit ASCII was not being handled correctly in Windows.
 * This is really an admission that the way that Windows handles Unicode and command line arguments sucks, and it is my belief that
    having a wmain() or _tmain() declaration specific for Windows is a worse solution.  C'est la vie.
 * I'm very open to the idea that src/osd/osdcore.[cpp|h] is not the best place to do this.  Let me know if I should move it.

-Candela PAL driven address map (#2657) [Joakim Larsson EdstrÃ¶m]
 * mc6840ptm/mc6850acia: fixed so that LOG_OUTPUT_FUNC can be defined as printf

-Added comments and EuroPC II and EuroXT variants, corrected RAM size on EuroPC and slot configuration. EMS memory doesn't work on
 EuroPC II and XT (should be able to be configured from the BIOS, but options don't show up, DOS EMS driver doesn't load). [rfka01]

-Added support for viewing the pls100 device to jedutil [keshbach]

-Candela PAL driven address map tried a long time to use bank devices for this but as it used two levels of indirection, eg 2 banks
 of 16 banks each where each of the 16 banks can point to any device/ram/rom segment, it got very complex and it was never working
 and almost impossible to understand. So I rewrote it in plain code and a number of previously not working BASIC commands started
 working. There are more to do but this is a nice milestone towards booting OS9. [JoakimLarsson]
 * I also made some C11 strings legacy aware in the PTM and ACIA devices.

-sms/gamegear misc fixes [Enik Land]
 * correct author of the SMS multipad device hardware.
 * upper addresses of the SMS2/GG memory map unused by devices need to be mapped to RAM (fixes 'shero' GG game).

 * fix a soft reset bug in the mapper code for the '4pak' entry of the SMS software list.
 * remove two obsolete comments from the period when MESS didn't supported BIOS selection.
 * change two comments to document that player inputs on GG aren't disabled even in SMS mode.

-AEG Olympia Olytext 30 added. Additional Z80 card needs to be ... ... emulated to run original word processor. The Olytext 30 is an
 XT compatible, the BIOS works well with the PC emulation. The original word processor is running on a Z80 coprocessor card that

-hp16500: connect HIL MLC Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org> [sschnelle]

-68340: Fixed -validate errors and made slight cleanup Tried to address all of Vas comments from my previous commit [JoakimLarsson]

-demote Megaplay to not working, see notes basically I don't feel it's ever worked properly, and it has only got worse over the
 years, time to demote it. [DavidHaywood]

-clipper: interrupt handling fixes [pmackinlay]
 * improve interrupt vector handling
 * fix C300 interrupt entry and stack frame
 * fix pushw where source register is same as stack register
 * switch to logmacro.h logging
 * Note: this does break the InterPro system - it compiles, but interrupts don't work. The relevant changes are tangled up with
    other InterPro system changes that I'll submit later.

-upd765: sense interrupt status and i82072 changes [pmackinlay]
 * changed sense interrupt status drive busy bit handling for seek/recalibrate (only cleared when first result byte is read)
 * changed sis to return results in decrementing drive order
 * added i82072 motor on/off command
 * switched to logmacro.h logging convention
 * Note: I haven't tested the sense interrupt status change on anything other than the InterPro systems I'm targeting. Hopefully
    someone else is set up to do so: only the change to the order of sis results is dubious - it's not covered by the documentation
    I've seen so far, but relied on by the InterPro 2000 diagnostic code.

-i82586: fixed 82586 initialisation [pmackinlay]
 * tested 82586 device successfully (with InterPro 2000)
 * include heartbeat indicator on all transmits to pass InterPro diagnostic
 * corrected a bug affecting long frames (now allows up to 64k, slightly worried about the increase in save state, but don't have a
    better idea)

-hp9k_3xx: hook up keyboard/sound to HP9000/332 [sschnelle]

-hp9k_3xx: add 98603 ROM card Even if BASIC doesn't boot yet it's handy to have the ROM card in the code and BASIC in the software
 list. [sschnelle]

-Improved 68340, 68681 and dbox support A cleaner PR than my previous. I reached my mile stone as I am able to hook up a terminal to
 the serial port. In theory it will now be possible to flash the dbox with a shareware called DVB2000 by using a PC utility that
 connects over serial, it is not tested yet as I need to figure out how to do that, either from a DOSbox or a second MAME instance.
 Please review in particular the way I created the serial module by inherit the duart driver. I think it works well but there could
 impurities in the way I did it. [JoakimLarsson]

-dbox: added 29F800B flash boot device This should be a clean merge as no dependencies from other drivers towards this new device
 exists. I am also pending on this being merged to rebase and PR the rest of my dbox/68340  work [JoakimLarsson]

 * validate will now report an error if no matches occur [npwoods]

-HP9000/300: Add SN76494 sound device [sschnelle]

-HP9000/300: disable DMA controller workaround Faking the DMA register set with RAM makes the 'Failed' message go away, but makes
 the ROM use DMA functionality even if there's none. Seen this while working on HPIB support which tries to transfer data via DMA
 and fails. When disabling the DMA hack the ROM falls back to PIO mode. [sschnelle]

-HP9000/300: fix detection of DIO cards Install a buserror handler for the DIO/DIO-II card ranges. The 300 BOOT ROM expects to get a
 Buserror signal to detect if there's a card. Also remove the memory of PC's doing invalid Bus accesses as this breaks this
 detection. [sschnelle]

-Hil keyboard support for HP9000/300 [sschnelle]

-luaengine: translation support [Carl] Making a pull request for comment about whether this is wanted and if so how to add to
 workflow.  Seems to work fine with find with xgettext anyhow. [cracyc]

-Added a natural keyboard validation to check for valid natural keyboard (uni)codes I had to shuffle the SHIFT_COUNT/SHIFT_STATE
 enums around, and I also moved the "char casting" hack.  Vas might have opinions on how this was done. [npwoods]

-Returning a reference from various corestr.cpp calls to avoid unnecessary string copies [npwoods]

-upd765: added i82072 Minimal support for i82072: write access to the data rate select register is enough for InterPro 2000 support
 right now. [pmackinlay]

-add apple2_cass softlist This starts a cassette softlist for the apple2 series. Includes tapes with ml, integer basic, and
 applesoft basic. [Dagarman]

-Correct regions for Cyber Cycles, Dirt Dash, Time Crisis, Tokyo Wars and Armadillo Racing sets [sjy96525]

-Attempted to sanitize/rationalize how we access UTF-8 command line arguments Specifically, this creates a call
 osd_get_command_line() that returns UTF-8 command line arguments as std::vector<std::string>.  On non-Windows platforms, this does
 nothing more than build the vector.  On Windows, this invokes GetCommandLineW() and CommandLineToArgvW().  This also attempts to
 unwind usage of wmain()/_tmain() on Windows, which is not standard. [npwoods]
 * Related to this, this fixes a bug in Imgtool; specifically, non-7 bit ASCII was not being handled correctly in Windows.
 * This is really an admission that the way that Windows handles Unicode and command line arguments sucks, and it is my belief that
    having a wmain() or _tmain() declaration specific for Windows is a worse solution.  C'est la vie.
 * I'm very open to the idea that src/osd/osdcore.[cpp|h] is not the best place to do this.  Let me know if I should move it.
