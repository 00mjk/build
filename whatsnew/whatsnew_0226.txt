6704: rescap.h: Credit the actual authors (nw) [ajrhacker]
The exact authorship of a few of these definitions isn't quite clear, though @aaronsgiles had nothing to do with them as far as I
  can tell. I'm not sure how much credit other developers are willing to take for these, though, so I'll invite comments before
  merging.

6841: Implement TT5665 emulation [cam900]
Similar as OKIM6295, but with Support more ROM capacity and phrase spaces, 2 sound outputs
Used in bowltry, igs_m036 (for some hardwares with TT5665, ex: cjddzsp)
bowltry.cpp: Fix game name (BOWLING TRY! in both poster and PCB)

7203: Some nwk-tr changes [Hydreigon223]
This is an update for documentation as well as add some code from hornet.cpp's driver to correct the the whole "dual screen"
  situation. If anyone around here does have an nwk-tr system, it would be nice to know what the slave CG board displays on actual
  hardware.
My other changes:
- Added the second K001604. Since nwk-tr does use two CG boards, there should be a second K001604 as well. Also had to add
  additional read/write parameters to support using two K001604s for now.
- Updated network board documentation to better explain the chip at 2G, XICOR X76F041, and functions. Added NO_DUMP placeholders to
  the games that use this specific network board with the added eeprom.
- Renamed 'Thrill Drive (EAA) (thrilldae)' to 'Thrill Drive (EAB) (thrilldbe)' because the program rom used for this set uses the
  'B' version. Also removed the "BAD_DUMP" flag from the timekeeper because the network board and timekeeper region data do not
  match. I would add a parameter for thrilldbe to change the network region data to "EA" but I don't know if it's even worth
  changing the simulation (imo better to hook the correct device like with ksys573).
- Demoted thrilld and thrilldb to NOT_WORKING. The two never really worked to begin with and have gotten worse in later versions
  (freezes and crashes more often). I did test versions of mame with and without my edits and both act the same.
- Added voodoo and screen parameter changes by @cam900 from hornet.cpp. So far so good for this driver too.
- Added additional CG board roms for racingj and racingj2/j. According to racingj2's kit manual, it prompts the operator to change
  roms from the master and slave CG boards thus giving proof of the two using extra CG board roms. thrilld's kit manual doesn't
  prompt the operator to replace the slave CG board roms.
- Made some attempts to fix the handbrake with no avail. Adding another pedal input port may have to be necessary.

7274: dac/volt_reg: improve performance [aaronsgiles]
* modify dac to accept streams of any input rate to avoid resampling
* modify dac to assume input voltage streams are constant by only
   grabbing the first input sample
* modify volt_reg to output at the minimum sample rate

7280: P2000t: Add support for selecting memory and bankswitching. [pokowaka]
Philips released the following models:
P2000t/16 -> 16 Kb
P2000t/32 -> 32 Kb
P2000t/48 -> 48 Kb, with one bank switch 8k ram block
Later models supported even more memory, though the older
roms will not detect this properly.
P2000t/64 -> 64 Kb
P2000t/102 -> 102 Kb

7290: Major update for HC55516 CVSD audio device and related filtering, as well as hooking it to drivers. [Lord-Nightmare]
* Split hc55516 core into separate cores/subclasses for hc55516 and hc55532 (new 'digital' implementation based on decap/die
  tracing) as well as mc3417 and mc3418 (old existing 'analog' implementation left alone) and hooked the hc55516 and mc3417
  implementations to the appropriate hardware drivers. This should vastly improve CVSD sound quality in drivers that use the
  hc55516.[Lord Nightmare, Sean Riddle]
* Made Exidy's mouse trap use a timer to clock the mc3417 and update the state readable by the z80 rather than relying on the mc3417
  to accept a clock parameter and update the z80 state via a callback. The timer implementation ensures proper synchronization and
  prevents missed clock transitions from the z80 side causing noise in the CVSD audio. [Lord Nightmare]
* Added a biquad-based 2nd order filter emulation for an audio stream (to go along with flt_rc 1st order filter emulation) and
  hooked it to Exidy's mouse trap (mc3417) and williams drivers (hc55516) following the original schematics. For hc55516 this is
  necessary as the original chip produces a very pronounced audible 16khz 'carrier' in its output audio even on the real chip, and
  these filters suppress this. This also happens to a lesser extent with the 8khz quieting waveform noise on both mc3417 and
  hc55516. [Lord Nightmare]
* Made Williams System 11 and s11_bg relative sound mixing more accurate to the original audio flow on the PCB itself.
  [Lord Nightmare]
* Switched Williams Joust 2 to use the s11_bg common sound device rather than its own implementation [Lord Nightmare]

7292: macrossp.cpp: Add notes for quizmoon [cam900]

7295: FreeBSD fixes [evadot]
Those 3 commits (+2 in 3rdparty, see https://github.com/evadot/mame/commits/fbsd) makes mame compilable on FreeBSD.
I'll work with upstream so they include the fixes and get back here when it's done.
When everything compile out of the box I'll add a CI target as travis supports FreeBSD.

7296: namcos12.cpp: Add notes for RAM size [cam900]

7297: Complete sound modernization of remaining devices. Legacy callbacks and stream_sample_t removed. [aaronsgiles]

7298: picture_image_device::get_bitmap can return a null reference [ksherlock]
null references are not valid in C++ so compilers like to eliminate the null pointer check. This can result in a segfault,
eg, `mame apple2e -gameio compeyes` will segfault if no image (`-pic`) is provided.
switched to use a pointer instead.

7306: fmtowns: add devices for the SCSI card slot and the FMT-121 card [rzero9]
This update adds a slot device to the first-generation FM Towns models that represents the dedicated 30-pin slot for the FMT-121
  SCSI Card, and another device for the card itself. This is a one-off slot that only exists in the Model 1 and 2, and only supports
  that one card (as far as I know).
This allows users to use hard disks with the original "fmtowns" machine in a realistic way, as an optional slot card (instead of the
  "fake" integrated controller it had in older versions of MAME, that was removed with commit
  2576f614e6c9b7da6f9ddd936356b3262a1dd0c4), with the -scsislot option:
mame64 fmtowns -scsislot fmt121 -hard1 harddisk.chd
This is the first time I deal with slot devices, so I used the Pasopia PAC2 and X68000 slots as reference. It's a very simple card,
  but I hope everything meets the MAME standards.

7307: sgi_mips.xml: more Hot Mix CDs for SGI [darkstar]
This commit adds some more "Hot Mix" CDs to the SGI softlist. They were all sourced from the Internet and are not dumped by me,
  that's why they are all standard MODE1 dumps (not RAW)
I also corrected the year on the Hot Mix 11 and Hot Mix 12 CDs:
* For Hot Mix 11, the year in the ISO9660 PVD is 1995, and all files are also dated 1995, and the copyright in the file
  "HTML/APPSDIR/APPS.HTM" also says 1995
* For Hot Mix 12, all files are dated 1995, and since it's unlikely to have come before Hot Mix 11, 1995 is certainly the correct
  year
For the naming ("Hot Mix Volume X" vs. just "Hot Mix X") I looked at various sources
* For Volume 1, the string "Hot Mix, Volume One" appears in the README on disc
* For Volume 9, the cover says "Volume 9" (as can be seen on later Hot Mix CDs, as the covers are included as GIF files)
* For Volumes 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16, the string "Hot Mix Volume X" or some variant thereof appears in some README file on the disc
  and/or the ISO9660 PVD
The SGI P/Ns were sourced from lists and databases on the internet, mainly this
The CHD files themselves are still uploading but will be available here in a bit

7308: drdmania: add some basics, still seems to do nothing of note [DavidHaywood]

7311: darius: fix: MSM5205 output ports are inverted [yaei]
darius: fix: MSM5205 output ports are inverted
The stereo output channels of ADPCM chip (OKI MSM5205) are inverted.
I've confirmed it on the output of an actual arcade machine instance and the official soundtrack.
Confirmation method :
Start any variant of Darius and press F2, F3.
When the monitor test screen comes up, press 1 Player Start to enter the test mode.
Press P1 Up 46 times to set the SOUND CODE to 2E.
Press 1 Player Start to play the track 'Inorganic Beat'.
Compare the ADPCM part with official soundtrack
( e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4toor1KlugA ) .

7312: - split off the handhelds that seem to be based around gpl162xx technology into their own file from

- split off the handhelds that seem to be based around gpl162xx technology into their own file from generalplus_gpl_unknown.cpp to
  generalplus_gpl162xx_lcdtype.cpp
- identify unkunsp based on new information
(I'll rename sets + add extra in a separate PR for clarity)

7313: sgi_mips.xml: Add Developer Toolbox CDs [darkstar]
This PR adds the developer toolbox CDs from nixzone.nl.
I could not find any SGI P/N for them online, so for now they were added without. The year was inferred from the README and
  COPYRIGHT files on the CD. The only information I could find is this archived page on irixnet (which was archived from
  nekochan.net before it went dark), which has some pictures of the Developer Toolbox 4.2 CD
Yes, the Developer Toolbox 6.1 really starts numbering with CD 0 (not CD 1), confirmed by the README on the first CD.
The CHDs are available to download here

7320: darius2 darius2d warriorb: fix: stereo output channels are inverted [yaei]
darius2 darius2d warriorb: fix: stereo output channels are inverted
Stereo output channels on Darius II / Warrior Blade are inverted .
It can be observed on titles that use same hardware.
As for darius2, both dual screen and triple screen variants have same issue.
I've compared it with actual arcade machines and official soundtracks.
Step to reproduce/comparison:
Start any variant of Darius II(darius2/darius2d/sagaia ...) and press F2, F3.
When the monitor test screen comes up, press [1 Player Start] to enter the test mode.
Press [P1 Up] 10 times to set the SOUND value to 0A.
Press [1 Player Start] to play the track 'Olga Breeze'.
Compare the playback with a proper source
( e.g. https://mora.jp/package/43000033/ZTTL9023/  track#3) .
Start warriorb and press F2, F3.
When the monitor test screen comes up, press [1 Player Start] to enter the test mode.
Press [P1 Up] 12 times to set the SOUND value to C0.
Press [P1 Button 1]  to play the track 'B.G.M.1 "Rising"'.
Compare the playback with a proper source
( e.g. https://mora.jp/package/43000033/ZTTL-9072/  track#4) .
ninjaw ( The Ninja Warriors: which uses the same emulation code with darius2) should have the same issue but I can't confirm it
  because it seems that the game don't utilize any stereo outout.

It will also upload the resulting executable as artifact so that it can be used for regression testing.
This commit also removes the unused TeaCI drone files.

7337: pacman.cpp: upgrade clubpacm and clubpacma to working [devinacker]
These two commits add/improve a few things for `clubpacm` and `clubpacma`:
* Multiplexed P1/P2 joystick inputs for Double Command mode in `clubpacm`
* Corrections to other inputs (including dip switches)
* Simple protection(?) latch needed by at least `clubpacma`
Both of these sets should now be in good shape, aside from some bugs in the games themselves (which I tried to document in comments
  where possible, e.g. the broken free play setting).
The only thing I'm not really sure about is whether `clubpacm` is supposed to support third and fourth joysticks for the other side
  of a cocktail table, or if it's even intended to be playable in cocktail mode in the first place...

7360: vsnes: working sound + "improved" graphics in Vs. SMB bootleg sets [devinacker]
Based on kevtris' schematics and video, these commits:
* get the two SN76489s connected and working (w/ the expected Z80 interrupt behavior when the 6502 writes sound registers)
* run the 6502, Z80, and both SN76489s at the correct clock speeds
* add a new PPU subclass `ppu2c04_clone_device` which implements the bootlegs' register behavior, palettes, video timing, and other
  differences
* mark the Z80 ROM in the `suprmriobl3` set as a bad dump due to corrupted return instructions in both interrupt handlers
I removed `MACHINE_NOT_WORKING` from sets 1 and 2 but left it on set 3 due to the bad Z80 ROM.
What I'm not sure about at the moment:
* Audio levels: I have both SN76489s at 50% right now, but it seems "better" to have the second one closer to 100% instead
  (otherwise its emulation of the noise channel is much quieter than it seems from kevtris' video footage)

7384: msm5232: fix: behaviour when the 'arm' flag set while envelope generator is on a decay state [yaei]
msm5232, a tone generator chip which is used by some early TAITO and Alpha Denshi arcade PCBs, has 'arm' flag that alters behaviour
  of envelope generation.
Basically, the 'arm' flag turns Attack-Decay-Release envelope generation to simpler ON/OFF states.
If the 'arm' flag set, the transition from Attack to Decay doesn't occur unless explicitly indicated.
On current implement, when this 'arm' flag is set on a channel which is on a Decay state, the Decay state continues.
It seems that, the state should be turned into a Attack state in this situation.

7388: k001005.cpp: Add missing command [Hydreigon223]
Added a missing command only used in jetwave's "How to Control" screen.  This screen would show some model of the jetski in turning
  the handlebars and leaning on the jetski for controls. This fixes an issue where not only the model(s) wouldn't be present but the
  game would slow down complaining about an unknown polygon command.

7390: fix a Genesis VDP status bit which was breaking Mega Play 68k->Z80 comms [devinacker]
A bit of a strange one this time, hopefully I can explain it well enough...
This fixes the "odd interlace frame" bit in the VDP status register so that it is only set if interlace is actually enabled. Believe
  it or not, this was actually the cause of the 68k/Z80 communications issues in Mega Play games that were causing the two CPUs to
  get confused about the current game state.
This appears to fix all of the sets in megaplay.cpp, but I'll use some 68k code from Sonic 2 as an example.
Every frame, the game checks the "odd frame" bit here, and sets/clears a flag in RAM accordingly:
```
ROM:000003AE                 move.w  ($C00004).l,d0
ROM:000003B4                 btst    #4,d0
ROM:000003B8                 beq.s   loc_3D0
ROM:000003BA                 move.b  #$40,($FFFFAE).l ; interlace odd frame = set flag in RAM
ROM:000003C2                 move.b  #$40,($A10007).l
ROM:000003CA                 movem.w (sp)+,d0
ROM:000003CE                 bra.s   loc_3E2
ROM:000003D0 ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROM:000003D0
ROM:000003D0 loc_3D0:
ROM:000003D0                 clr.b   ($FFFFAE).l     ; otherwise clear it
ROM:000003D6                 move.b  #0,($A10007).l
```
Later on, when the 68k sends a message to the BIOS, this flag is (for whatever reason) repeatedly ORed with the data being shifted
  into the I/O port:
```
ROM:000012D0                 rol.w   #2,d0           ; write next two bits into the I/O port
ROM:000012D2                 or.b    ($FFFFAE).l,d0  ; bitwise-OR the odd frame flag into the remaining data, for some reason
ROM:000012D8                 move.b  d0,d6
ROM:000012DA                 andi.b  #$43,d6
ROM:000012DE                 move.w  d6,d4
ROM:000012E0                 ori.w   #4,d4
ROM:000012E4                 move.b  d4,($A10007).l
[...]
ROM:000012F8                 move.b  d6,($A10007).l
```
As a result, if that flag in RAM is set while this is happening, it causes the wrong data to get shifted out, which was resulting in
  the BIOS frequently missing messages from the 68k and leaving the game in a weird state as a result.
The VDP fix was checked against the VDP implementation in Blast'Em, and all Mega Play games appear to work fine as a result of the
  fix.

New working software list additions (apple2_flop_clcracked.xml)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Negotation Edge (cleanly cracked) [4am, Firehawke]

-Cleaned up bitmap API. [Vas Crabb]
 * Made const-qualified pixel accessors (pix, pixt, raw_pixptr) return const-qualified references/pointers to pixesl, and added
    non-const versions.  This makes bitmap more like standard library containers where const protects the content as well as the
    dimensions.
 * Made the templated pixt accessor protected - having it public makes it too easy to inadvertently get a pointer to the wrong
    location.
 * Removed the pix(8|16|32|64) accessors from the specific bitmaps.  You could only use the "correct" one anyway, and having the
    "incorrect" ones available prevented explicit instantiations of the class template because the static assertions would fail.
    You can still see the pixel type in the bitmap class names, and you can't assign the result of &pix(y, x) to the wrong kind of
    pointer without a cast.
 * Added fill member functions to the specific bitmap template, and added a explicit instantiations.  This allows the bitmap size
    check to be skipped on most bitmap fills, although the clipping check is still there.  Also fixed a couple of places that were
    trying to fill an indexed 16-bit bitmap with rgb_t::black() exposed by this (replaced with zero to get the same net effect).
    The explicit template instantiations in the .cpp file mean the compiler can inline the function if necessary, but don't need to
    generate a local out-of-line body if it chooses not to.
 * Extended the size of the fill value parameter in the base bitmap class to 64 bits so it works correctly for 64-bit bitmaps.
 * Fixed places where IE15 and VGM visualiser weren't accounting for row bytes potentially being larger than width.
 * Fixed an off-by-one in an HP-DIO card where it was treating the Topcat cursor right edge as exclusive.
 * Updated everything to work with the API changes, reduced the scope of many variables, added more const, and replaced a few
    fill/copy loops with stuff from <algorithm>.

-FreeBSD fixes (#7295) [Emmanuel Vadot]
 * psixptty: Fix for FreeBSD
   - We need to check for __FreeBSD__ not __FreeBSD_kernel__
 * FreeBSD: Use gl includes from pkg-config
   - FreeBSD doesn't install the includes from 3rdparty software in a default location so use pkg-config to get the correct path.
 * FreeBSD: genieos is named simple bsd

-netlist: Fix astro blaster sonar sound [couriersud]
 * Also fix two singular matrices being created.

-picture_image_device::get_bitmap was returning a possibly-null reference [Kelvin Sherlock]
 * null references are not valid/undefined in C++ so compilers like to eliminate the null pointer check.
 * switched to returning a pointer instead.

-netlist: Rewrote frontier documentation. [couriersud]
 * Also includes a small optimization for FP signal code.

-netlist: Fix a net splitting issue with four term devices. [couriersud]
 * Under cirtum circumstances the splitter would create "ghost" solvers consisting of terminals already used in another and complete
    solver. This may impact all netlist which use opamps and thus is committed early in the cycle.
 * This commit adds functionality to instruct the splitter code to include terminals which will not create matrix elements into the
    parsing of net groups for solvers.

-netlist: Convert driver filenames to lower case. [couriersud]

-emu/machine.cpp: Get rid of remaining make_unique_clear on 'manager' objects. [Vas Crabb]

-sound/discrete: Reserve space before taking addresses of new vector items. [Vas Crabb]
 * This code is still unsafe, 16 just happens to be enough for the systems in MAME.  (The old vector_t implicitly reserved space for
    16 items on construction.)

-sound/discrete.cpp: Fix more crashes, and modernise a little. [Vas Crabb]
 * Reserve some space in another vector that it takes addresses to members of (fixes lack of sound in dkong and dkongjr).
 * Removed dependence on auto_alloc and friends.  There's one more problematic make_unique_clear now, but there are several fewer
    auto_alloc family calls.

-sound/discrete: Get rid of vtables in factories. [Vas Crabb]
 * This speeds up compilation.

-radio86: fixed ^ natural key [Robbbert]

-sdk86: fixed Paste; got rid of terminal, since the system is meant to interface with an intellec unit, and this requires floppy
 disks and drives. [Robbbert]

-Got rid of global_alloc/global_free. [Vas Crabb]
 * The global_alloc/global_free functions have outlived their usefulness. They don't allow consistently overriding the default
    memory allocation behaviour because they aren't used consistently, and we don't have standard library allocator wrappers for
    them that we'd need to use them consistently with all the standard library containers we're using.  If you need to change the
    default allocator behaviour, you can override the new/delete operators, and there are ways to get more fine-grained control that
    way.  We're already doing that to pre-fill memory in debug builds.
 * Code was already starting to depend on global_alloc/global_free wrapping new/delete.  For example some parts of the code
    (including the UI and Windows debugger) was putting the result of global_alloc in a std::unique_ptr wrappers without custom
    deleters, and the SPU sound device was assuming it could use global_free to release memory allocated with operator new.  There
    was also code misunderstanding the behaviour of global_alloc, for example the GROM port cartridge code was checking for nullptr
    when a failure will actually throw std::bad_alloc.
 * As well as substituting new/delete, I've made several things use smart pointers to reduce the chance of leaks, and fixed a couple
    of leaks, too.

-netlist: rename more files to lower case. [couriersud]

-spkrdev: Fix sample volume averaging [AJR]

-pc98_cd.xml:  This change fixes the mismatch for the only known case where CHD label ended in a "." (in this case "...") which is
 typically an extension separation.  CHD label entries in source are always ".CHD" as actual filenames and extensions are stripped
 off which is why the 'toshin2s' entry scanned internally and with most common external utilities as not needing the trailing period
 marks. [Scott Stone]

-pacman.cpp: promoted clubpacm and clubpacma to working (#7337) [Devin Acker]
 * Corrected inputs for clubpacm.
 * Added inputs and protection latch for clubpacma.
 * Restructured clubpacm I/O stuff a bit.

-Major update for HC55516 CVSD audio device and related filtering, as well as hooking it to drivers. (#7290) [Jonathan Gevaryahu]
 * Split hc55516 core into separate cores/subclasses for hc55516 and hc55532 (new 'digital' implementation based on decap/die
    tracing) as well as mc3417 and mc3418 (old existing 'analog' implementation left alone) and hooked the hc55516 and mc3417
    implementations to the appropriate hardware drivers. This should vastly improve CVSD sound quality in drivers that use the
    hc55516. [Lord Nightmare, Sean Riddle]
 * Made Exidy's mouse trap use a timer to clock the mc3417 and update the state readable by the z80 rather than relying on the
    mc3417 to accept a clock parameter and update the z80 state via a callback. The timer implementation ensures proper
    synchronization and prevents missed clock transitions from the z80 side causing noise in the CVSD audio. [Lord Nightmare]
 * Added a biquad-based 2nd order filter emulation for an audio stream (to go along with flt_rc 1st order filter emulation) and
    hooked it to Exidy's mouse trap (mc3417) and williams drivers (hc55516) following the original schematics. For hc55516 this is
    necessary as the original chip produces a very pronounced audible 16khz 'carrier' in its output audio even on the real chip, and
    these filters suppress this. This also happens to a lesser extent with the 8khz quieting waveform noise on both mc3417 and
    hc55516. [Lord Nightmare]
 * Made Williams System 11 and s11_bg relative sound mixing more accurate to the original audio flow on the PCB itself.
    [Lord Nightmare]
 * Switched Williams Joust 2 to use the s11_bg common sound device rather than its own implementation. [Lord Nightmare]

-emu3: Removed unneeded fdc reset. [Nigel Barnes]

Cow Tipping - Shake Cattle & Roll (set 2) [Recreativas.org, Francisco Ortiz]

-emu/natkeyboard.cpp: Allow keyboard devices to be enabled/disabled. [Vas Crabb]
 * This fixes the "typing on all keyboards at once" issue.  You can now enable and disable keyboard/keypad inputs per device in the
    Keyboard Mode menu.  Default is to enable the first device with keyboard inputs, and all device with keypad inputs but no
    keyboard inputs.  The settings are saved in the CFG file for the machine.
 * Typing in natural keyboard mode only ever types on one keyboard at a time, but now you can control which keyboard it types on, as
    it will be the first enabled keyboard.
 * You can easily try this out with something like: mame64d zorba -rs232 terminal cpm

-ui/inputmap.cpp: Show device descriptions as well as tag paths. [Vas Crabb]

-mac128.cpp: Fixed mouse axis wrap compensation, cleaned up mouse code, eliminated static variables for mouse input state.
 [Vas Crabb]
 * You could see the issue with wrap detection easily enough just by running mac128k/mac512k/macplus and tapping the arrow keys to
    move the mouse one pixel at a time.  As you moved past the point where the axis count wrapped, it would move one pixel in the
    opposite direction.
 * There were two function static variables related to mouse input state, probably still lurking from when the code was initially
    made to use a driver state class.  This obviously messes with save states and prevents multiple instances.

-bus/a2bus/mouse.cpp: Fixed mouse axis wrap compensation. [Vas Crabb]
 * This device had the same bug with wrap compensation as mac128k.cpp.

-kaypro: merged software lists, using compatibility flag instead. [Robbbert]

-Some nwk-tr changes (#7203) [Hydreigon]
 * Updated documentation as well as added some code from hornet.cpp's driver to correct the the whole "dual screen" situation.
 * Added the second K001604. Since nwk-tr does use two CG boards, there should be a second K001604 as well. Also had to add
    additional read/write parameters to support using two K001604s for now.

    the games that use this specific network board with the added eeprom.
 * Renamed 'Thrill Drive (EAA) (thrilldae)' to 'Thrill Drive (EAB) (thrilldbe)' because the program rom used for this set uses the
    'B' version. Also removed the "BAD_DUMP" flag from the timekeeper because the network board and timekeeper region data do not
    match. I would add a parameter for thrilldbe to change the network region data to "EA" but I don't know if it's even worth
    changing the simulation (imo better to hook the correct device like with ksys573).
 * Demoted thrilld and thrilldb to NOT_WORKING. The two never really worked to begin with and have gotten worse in later versions
    (freezes and crashes more often). I did test versions of mame with and without my edits and both act the same.
 * Added voodoo and screen parameter changes by @cam900 from hornet.cpp. So far so good for this driver too.
 * Added additional CG board roms for racingj and racingj2/j. According to racingj2's kit manual, it prompts the operator to change
    roms from the master and slave CG boards thus giving proof of the two using extra CG board roms. thrilld's kit manual doesn't
    prompt the operator to replace the slave CG board roms.
 * Made some attempts to fix the handbrake with no avail. Adding another pedal input port may have to be necessary.

-m68000: Separate FPU code from header [AJR]

-Revet #7346. [Vas Crabb]
 * The project won't move forward if we're not proactive about ensuring legacy code isn't added.  In particular, this PR contained
    the kind of code that we need to remove in order to be able to move to proper per-device outputs and to allow clients to
    enumerate a system's outputs on start; and runtime tagmap lookups for I/O ports, which can't be checked on validation and hence
    require exercising all code paths to detect errors (as well as the performance issues).
 * The pull request had outstanding reviews requesting changes.  It's not acceptable to ignore that and merge it.
 * This reverts changes from e3dbb0fa43b78cf01e1f74b6dcc6fc8a7f4fc474 and fc8330e65cb0713a1931b7b3d771c37d5ffd020b.

-msm5232: fix: behaviour when the 'arm' flag set while envelope generator is on a decay state [eito]
 * msm5232, a tone generator chip which is used by some early TAITO and Alpha Denshi arcade PCBs, has 'arm' flag that alters
    behavoiur of envelope generation.
 * Basically, the 'arm' flag turns Attack-Decay-Release envelope generation to simpler ON/OFF states. If the 'arm' flag set, the
    transition from Attack to Decay doesn't occur unless explicitly indicated.
 * On current implement, when this 'arm' flag is set on a channel which is on a Decay state, the Decay state continues. It seems
    that, the state should be turned into a Attack state in this situation.
