7693: firebeat: Implement SPU DMAs and fix SPU device configurations [987123879113]
There are two SPU configurations implemented here:
- pop'n music which uses DVDs
- beatmania III which uses HDDs
This PR allows for all pop'n music games to be booted but some things will not work properly without further changes to rf5c400
  which will come in a future PR. beatmania III HDD issues are also partially fixed by this PR.
Other changes:
firebeat: Documented some unknown ports including dipswitches (verified positions using PPP and beatmania III)
firebeat: Swapped sound channels (tested in various Firebeat games, I think it was PPP that even showed you "left", "center",
  "right")
k057714: Set an initial display width and height. This fixes some visual glitching for games that don't set the display size
  manually (beatmania III).
k057714: 44130d5dd9aca78ac2fba84c2cc05f8653be6f35 introduced a regression in beatmania III causing the game to no longer display
  anything which was caused by the m_reg_6c hack for Keyboardmania. I added a hack based on beatmania III's usage of m_reg_6c to fix
  the issue until I get a chance to look at it properly. This fixes beatmania III and leaves Keyboardmania the same as before.

7699: rf5c400: Fix looping, implement new register [987123879113]
This is the fix mentioned in https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/7693 that is required for pop'n music and beatmania III to work
  properly.
### Looping notes from various games/systems
pop'n music Mickey Tunes (Firebeat)
beatmania III THE FINAL (Firebeat)
beatmania IIDX 7th Style (Twinkle)
- Will set loop offset to somewhere in the range between start and end when it wants to actually loop somewhere
- Will set the loop offset to 7 when it does not want to loop (= just loop tail end of sample until the channel is stopped?)
- (Firebeat only) Will set the loop offset higher than the buffer length when it wants to loop back to the beginning of the buffer.
  This mode seems to be used in conjunction with rf5c400_r 0x09 using the rf5c400's playback offset to determine the appropriate
  timing for DMA updates.

- It looks like the loop offset is being used to store a duration here, to offset like the original code was doing: `pos - loop`

7721: firebeat: Large refactor + initial beatmania III support [987123879113]
This is a large refactor of the Firebeat driver as discussed in #7693 so please forgive me for the huge PR with a meaningless diff.
  I've tried to make note of anything below that I've changed during the refactoring that wasn't just structural refactoring.
All games on the Firebeat platform except those with missing HDD data (`bm36th` and `bm3core`) have been tested to make sure they
  are still booting into gameplay and inputs responding as expected.
All of the required new ROMs for this PR have been sent to `code ( at ) mamedev`.
NOTE: Even with this PR, pop'n music *will not* boot as-is currently due to lack of support for the DVD CHDs. The CHDs are made as
  HDD CHDs which can't be loaded by the CD-ROM emulation code. The pop'n music games will work if you extract the raw data from the
  existing CHDs and rebuild them using `chdman createcd` but that is just a workaround. I will try to fix this in a future PR.
NOTE 2: RTC initialization for pop'n music, `bm3`, and `bm3core` are locked behind a randomly generated password for which you were
  supposed to call Konami to get a password that corresponds to your dongle serial ID + seed. This is not a bug, it's a feature
  (thanks Konami). You will need to use a tool I made to generate the required passwords.
Source code: https://github.com/987123879113/firebeatrtc
Web version: https://987123879113.github.io/firebeatrtc/
Ideally there should be a way to include a clean initialized RTC file in the ROM dumps so as to not require everyone to input a
  password but I couldn't find a way to do that with the RTC65271 so that's on hold for now.
---
Changelog:
- firebeat: Refactored entire monolith `firebeat_state` into (hopefully) logical components based on machine configurations. The
  Firebeat system is highly modular and each individual game has its own machine configuration, sometimes with the same boards being
  populated differently between games. I attempted to recreate that in the code so that only the components that are required for
  each game are loaded.
Also discussed in #7693, in the future I will look at splitting the SPU code off into its own machine to be shared with Twinkle
  because the two have nearly identical SPUs but that will be for another PR.
- firebeat: Rewrote `cabinet_r` register
Every game treats this a little differently so the initial value needs to be set based on cabinet type, which includes whether the
  machine is an overseas or Japanese machine, a rental or a purchase machine, and some other bits to determine actual machine type.
The values picked have all been checked by debugging the games to verify happy paths without requiring any additional hacks. These
  values are also tied to the specific dongle used in some cases which is why "normal" type dongles have been provided to replace
  all of the old non-"normal" type dongles (see below for more details).
- firebeat SPU: Changed dipswitch register to use dipswitch inputs instead of a function because the dipswitches are accessible on
  the board
- firebeat SPU: Added documentation for unknown parts of SPU code (IRQs 1 and 2, register 0x220000)
- firebeat SPU: Added attempt to ease blocking issues between audio CPU and main CPU during DMAs.
DMA handling is done entirely by the audio CPU. It's expected that the audio CPU can perform DMAs asynchronously apart from the main
  CPU in order to refill the BGM sound buffer while songs are being played.
The existing DMA code from my previous PR works as a bare minimum implementation but will block during large DMAs (size >=
  0x1000000) which are frequent in beatmania III and pop'n music.
- firebeat ParaParaParadise/beatmania III: `sensor_r` has been changed from a 32-bit register to 16-bit based on the way beatmania
  III reads the turntable's values as two separate 16-bit values (upper and lower). The appropriate changes were made to PPP's
  sensor inputs and tested to make sure inputs still worked.
- firebeat Keyboardmania: Swapped keyboard inputs to match I/O test menu (P1 should be left screen, P2 should be right screen now)
- firebeat beatmania III: Added new game: `bm3` added as `MACHINE_NOT_WORKING`
- firebeat beatmania III: Added proper SPUs/ROMs for all beatmania III games
- firebeat beatmania III: Added basic I/O emulation. Does not support Zoom ST-224 effects board or FDD.
- firebeat beatmania III: A hack (similar to what was used until recently in System 573 for `ddr2ml`/`ddr2mla` security plate
  errors) was added to bypass the FDD errors in all beatmania III games. The FDD only adds saving and loading scores and will
  otherwise run without errors if it's patched out. The patches have been tested on all beatmania III games. The patches will be
  removed when FDD emulation is implemented enough that the games can be loaded without the patches.
- firebeat pop'n music: Added new games: `popnmt`, `popnmt2`, `popnanm` added as `MACHINE_NOT_WORKING`
- firebeat ROMs: Replaced/added dongles for the following games
    - `ppp`
    - `ppd`
    - `ppp1mp`
    - `ppp11`
    - `kbm`
    - `kbm2nd`
    - `popn6`
    - `popn7`
    - `popn8`
    - `popnanm2`
    - `bm36th`
    - `bm37th`
    - `bm3final`
    All of the replacement dongles are generated through a tool, not dumped from security keys. All generated dongles have also been
  marked as BAD_DUMP to be sure that they don't get mixed up with real dongles. All dongles have been tested to make sure they boot
  in-game as expected.
    A large majority of the previous dongles dongles were also manually generated instead of dumped from the real security keys. The
  reason the old ones needed to be replaced is because the dongle type used by the old dongles was often the wrong one (service or
  manufacture type instead of a normal dongle) which in some cases caused the game to not load properly or in a way that it would
  not normally on real hardware with real dongles. There are legit dongle dumps in MAME already (`kbm3rd`, `popn4`, `popn5`,
  `bm3core`) which were used as references to generate as accurate as possible dongles. The main differences being the serial number
  and the lack of 8 bytes at the end of each file, which are not used at all during emulation, also data which the previous fake
  dongles lacked. An easy way to tell apart the fake from real dongle dumps is the fakes are 0xc0 bytes in size while real are 0xc8
  bytes in size.

Hi,
I've just added the support for external ROMs to HP integral PC. At the moment I'm only aware of the existence of a "Software

I'm going to e-mail this ROM's image shortly.
Thanks.

7727: hh_sm510.cpp: gnw_egg rom verified to be the same as gnw_mmouse [algestam]
The gnw_egg rom has been verified to be the same as gnw_mmouse (as expected).
The MCU chip is labelled `MC-25` on the Egg pcb. I'm not sure if this should be reflected in the driver by changing the ROM name
  from `eg-26` in the `ROM_LOAD` statement to `mc-25`. If it should, I can update the PR.

7728: viper: Add new dongles for ppp2nd (JAA), add new game ppp2nda (AAA) as MACHINE_NOT_WORKING, and add ppp2nd/a IO [987123879113]
Previously this game would error out immediately with a security check error due to the placeholder `ds2430.u3`. I've generated
  working dongles that will allow the games to boot as retail (non-rental type cabinet) JAA (Japan region) and AAA (Asia region)
  region codes. These are generated (not real dumps) so they are both still marked as `BAD_DUMP` to be sure. `ppp2nda` uses the same
  data as `ppp2nd` except the dongle tells it to boot AAA region instead of JAA. JAA will be in Japanese, AAA will be in English.
  Since it is the only way to play in English I included it as a separate game entry.
Sensor mappings worked the same as Firebeat so I just copied those over and added the read handler. I gave it a quick test in-game
  and all buttons including the sensors respond as expected in the I/O test menu now.
Sound and the external DVD player does not work so these games are still unplayable.
Edit: Just to be clear, there may be differences in the HDD on a real AAA dump but that's an unknown for now. It can be updated in
  the future if someone does dump one from an AAA machine eventually.

7741: Reinstated RI Handler [fergusleen]
The COMMSTAR ROM software won't run due to the ring indicator bit 4 of the DART RR0 being high when it's expected to be 0. 
If line 55 is uncommented bit 4 is low as expected and the software runs.
I've tried a few different pieces of mid 80's comms software and all is good.
Reading between the lines of forum posts back in 2014. It seems that the z80 dart emulation has been improved since then and I think
  now's the time to reinstate that line.
The routine in cpc_ser/COMMSTAR1.ROM that reads the z80 dart RR0 are:

7742: fmtowns_flop.xml: 4 new dumps, 1 replacement [rzero9]
A bit more of an explanation for this update:
- The "cracked" entries were created recently by cyo.the.vile himself. The protected versions work in MAME, but these can be useful
  for people that want to write the images back to real disks, or use them in other emulators.
- The "toshintoa" clone of Toushin Toshi has been removed, since dumping one more copy of the game has revealed that the "alternate"
  version of disk B just had an additional file created long after the release of the game that wasn't present in the original
  unmodified disk. Also, disks A and E have been replaced with clean unmodified copies.

7765: svga_s3.cpp: Add BIOS for S3 86C775/785 and ExpertColor M50-02 86C775 (both V.1.01.04) [jordigahan, ClawGrip] [clawgrip]

7766: bgfx crt-geom and crt-geom-deluxe enhancements [cgwg]
Contains three changes to these shaders:
1. A "brightness boost" feature for the shadow mask that works by making the brightness ratio between bright and dark mask pixels
  closer to 1 for the brighter parts of the image. I've been careful to ensure that the average of bright and dark mask pixels still
  varies linearly, so that the tone curve is unaffected as long as the gamma of the output display is set correctly.
2. Clamping to zero so that underscanning produces a black border.
3. In crt-geom-deluxe, a "raster bloom" effect that makes the image grow slightly when the average brightness of the screen is high.
  This mimics a common defect in CRTs and has been previously implemented in the shader called crt-guest-dr-venom. I find the effect
  kind of nice when the image fades in from black.
One detail I am uncertain about comes from the brightness boost feature: this required encoding some extra information in the alpha
  channel of the shadow mask textures. I wrote a very simple Python script to do this and have included this script, but perhaps
  this is inappropriate or it should be put in a different directory.
Finally: the shaders have only been compiled for glsl; someone else will have to generate the full set of shader targets.

7770: Clean genie scripts from missing/duplicate files [stengun]
This fix was needed because genie generated cmake files will complain about files that does not exist. Digging into genie scripts
  showed that building scripts also lacked some files, had duplicate ones or wrong named ones. All happened on header files,
  probably that's the reason why the problem didn't show up.
On some files also the scripts ended with having only cpp sources (ie. m5), having read their includes I realized that they _may_
  not need it, but I ask for a complete review of this even if I compiled mame successfully and started those systems.

7773: Update generalplus_gpl16250_mobigo.cpp [AlesanddroPB95]

7781: raiden_ms.cpp: sound improvements [devinacker]
This couple of commits fixes up main-to-sound-CPU communication and a few details of YM and ADPCM writes from the sound CPU so that
  music and sound effect playback get triggered correctly.
The FM audio still doesn't sound _great_, but it's at least functional.

7787: Eliminate ARRAY_LENGTH template in favor of C++17's std::size [ajrhacker]
* osdcomm.h: Move definition of EQUIVALENT_ARRAY to coretmpl.h

  jangou_blitter.cpp, vic4567.cpp: Use std::fill(_n) instead of memset
* emucore.h: Remove obsolete typedef
Note: I'm opening this pull request to see how the CI builds deal with the changes, which affect OSD stuff which has caused some
  unpleasant surprises with past refactorings. I don't have total confidence that all compilers support the standard equally well.

7790: add m68000 to debuger gdbstub [nabetse00]
Simple edit to debuggdbstub.cpp adding m68000 cpu support.
Tested with prebuilt Windows Toolchain for m68k-elf from here.
It Works with minor issues:
-  mame window cannot be moved util gdb connects and starts the emulation.
-  m68-elf-gdb complains about fpcontrol register not present (megadrive/genesis 68000 has no floating point capabilities)
-  Sometimes gdbstub stops to respond (maybe a problem from my test rom) nevertheless wathchdog option solves this.
Command line used (mame compiled from source with standard build mame build tools for windows):
```
.\mame.exe megadriv -cart .\roms\helloworld.bin -window -resolution  640x480 -debugger gdbstub -debugger_port 6868 -debug -watchdog
  10
```
Feel free to contact me for any changes.
I hope i'll be merge since it's a nice addin for megadrive/genesis retro devs, and for m68000 users in general.

-bgfx: crt-geom and crt-geom-deluxe enhancements (#7766) [cgwg]
 * Added a "brightness boost" feature for the shadow mask that works by making the brightness ratio between bright and dark mask
    pixels closer to 1 for the brighter parts of the image.
 * Added clamping to zero so that underscanning produces a black border.
 * Added a "raster bloom" effect to crt-geom-deluxe that makes the image grow slightly when the average brightness of the screen is
    high, mimicking a common defect in CRTs.
