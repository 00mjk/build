7830: fmtowns: adjust PCM volume [rzero9]
The volume of the PCM sound in the FM Towns driver has always been a bit too loud, but after the rewrite of the YM3438 core it has
  become even more evident, with the PCM sounds completely overpowering the FM instruments in music that uses both at the same time.
  The output of the RF5C68 was set to 3.00 gain, which is clearly too much, so this change sets it to 1.00, which sounds a lot
  closer to real hardware.
To demonstrate, here are recordings of the same track (from the game Deep) in:
- current MAME (after the FM rewrite): https://www.r-09.net/mame/deep_old.flac
- current MAME after this change: https://www.r-09.net/mame/deep_new.flac
- real hardware (original FM Towns Model 2): https://www.r-09.net/mame/deep_real.flac
The real thing seems to have some kind of lowpass filter that makes everything a lot "softer", but it should be enough to compare
  the volume levels.

Leapster L-MAX [Skaman]
Leapster 2 [Skaman]
Added two new BIOS versions to 'leapster' [Skaman]

7931: vgmplay: Ensure all writes to Yamaha FM chips are spaced by 1 cycle.  [aaronsgiles]
The old FM cores did not really require this spacing and didn't implement the busy flag, so many VGM captures have multiple writes
  stacked in the same cycle. This won't work with the new cores, so this kludge helps ensure we don't end up with ugly playback on
  existing files.

7942: options: extended the snapname templates to allow for a timestamp %t option, so to allow for alternate ways to organize the
  generated snaps. [etabeta78]

7960: leapfrog_leappad.cpp: Load ROMs as BIOSes instead of declaring clones [clawgrip]

7972: osx/sdl - caps lock [ksherlock]
As of SDL2 2.0.14, SDL on OS X synthesizes the caps lock key event by posting a keydown event, then immediately posting a key up
  event.  As there is no time for an intervening frame update between the two events, caps lock will never be seen by the emulator.
Perhaps there's a better solution but one could use a frame callback to give the caps lock key enough time to be seen. (It can't be
  the next frame because the sdl input callback will happen before the ioport frame callback)

  the PCB match other sets.
raiden2eub.zip

8001: Add a couple error messages to emu.thread. [Szunti]
Also changes exit(0) when the script of the thread returns non-string
to an error message instead. exit stops the whole process not just the
thread.

8002: Save line history for the console and other minor fixes [Szunti]
Changed a loadstring to load, since lua 5.3 loadstring is not
available.
Made sure the linenoise thread returns a string.
After Ctrl+D stop reading lines.

8003: fix gigandes sprite offsets (regressed around december) [DavidHaywood]

8004: upd7220, qx10: Implement display zoom support [brijohn]
This adds zoom support for the QX10 system.  Zooming on the upd7220 works by having the gpu rpeat each scanline the number of times
  equal to the programmed zoom factor. This will zoom in the vertical direction, the horizontal diretion requires external hardware
  on the machine in question to slow the fresh rate down which will create streched pixels allowing for soomin in the horizontal
  direction. On the QX10 the zoom rate for this external circuitry is set via the io port 0x3a.
This patch modifies the upd7220 so that it will multiple each Y count by the zoom factor and then updates the QX10 code to correctly
  multiply the X direction based on the value sent to the 0x3a io port.

8033: asuka.cpp: Added new clone earthjkrb: "U.N. Defense Force: Earth Joker (US / Japan, set 3)" [sergiopolog]
Added new clone earthjkrb to asuka.cpp
Dump credits to: JammaFever, Nebula, Recreativos Piscis, Spain
* Found in Taito PCB: K1100726A / J1100169B
* It only differs from parent set in 2 program roms: `4.ic23` and `3.ic8`. They are very close to the earthjkra set ones and only
  differs in 42 bytes in each rom.
* Eprom labels are numbered in the same way as earthjkrp set, but 3 and 4 ones are swapped (Maybe a typo in earthjkrp ?)
* Same ROMSTAR license and no region disclaimer when dipswitch is changed, like earthjkr and earthjkra sets.
* It seems a newer version than earthjkra set, including additional changes to those added in earthjkra in comparison to earthjkr
  set, as earthjkra and earthjkrb share the same changes from earthjkr.

8046: ymfm: Refactor new FM engine into a 3rdparty library [aaronsgiles]
This commit pulls out the core FM chip implementation into a 3rd party library, separately maintained here.
Changes in this PR include:
* Moved ymfm core implementation to 3rdparty/ymfm
* Split out each family (OPM/OPN/OPL/etc) into its own source file
* Added preliminary OPQ and OPZ support, still WIP
* Put all 3rdparty code into its own namespace ymfm
* Fixed various bugs reported in #8042
* Created interface class for communication between the 3rdparty engine and the emulator
* Standardized MAME implementation of all Yamaha devices based on a template class
* Created standard base class ym_generic that can be used when multiple YM chips are swapped in
* Changed YM2203/2608/2610 to embed an AY8910 as a subdevice instead of deriving from ay8910_device
* Also provided compile-time option to use a simplified built-in SSG rather than using MAME's at all (currently off)
* Consolidated MAME header files from one-per-chip (ym2151.h, ym2203.h, etc) to one-per-family (ymopm.h, ymopn.h, etc)
Prior to the bugfixes, the output of a sampling of all cores compared exactly with MAME 0.231 to within +/-1 on each 16-bit sample.
  The bugfixes have introduced additional discrepancies when fast envelope rates are used, which is expected.

  is not stored on the disc and an additional separate DAM karaoke system, which is unemulated, is required to actually play this.
Pic of PCB included for future reference. This is not my hardware so I don't have better pictures to provide.

this is an odd one, other system2 games clearly show that you can select between 16x16 and 32x32 mode with a bit in each sprite
  definition in the spriteram.
finallap needs 32x32 mode for the title screen, but fails to set the bit on any of the sprites. 
I don't think finallap ever needs 16x16 sprites (although more testing is needed)
finallap3 correctly sets it, and it is needed for cars ingame there

FM output volume is louder than DAC output volume in previous behavior, that's incorrect compared to real hardware.

8078: coco3: fix video glitch in Skiing [tlindner]
It is documented that the GIME monitors $FF22 to determine the proper legacy video mode. But it also monitors $FF23 to be sure $FF22
  is the data register and not the data direction register. This fixes MAME testers: https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=7512

8095: Apple softlist update for May 2012 [Firehawke]


Source Changes
--------------
-Add a couple error messages to emu.thread. [Szunti]
 * Also changes exit(0) when the script of the thread returns non-string to an error message instead. exit stops the whole process
    not just the thread.

-stfight: forgot to remove imperfect sound flag from cshootert where 2203 prescaler issue doesnt apply [hap]

-ram.cpp: update notes [hap]

-Save line history for the console and other minor fixes [Szunti]
 * Changed a loadstring to load, since lua 5.3 loadstring is not available. Made sure the linenoise thread returns a string. After
    Ctrl+D stop reading lines.

-dpb7000: Several tablet-related fixes. [Ryan Holtz] (#8006) [MooglyGuy]
 * The triggering of pen IRQs was slightly incorrect. With this change, the PENTEST utility now correctly reports pen-in-proximity
    when holding the input to flag it. The pen coordinates are wrong, however, which is expected.
 * The serial communication between the tablet board and TDS board was slightly incorrect. After this fix, the values being put into
    the SIO register by the Z8 correspond 1:1 with the values being received by the SCN2681 DUART.

-lc80: change some of the default input mappings [hap]

-lc80e: fix lockup problem [hap]

-Calomega.cpp general improvements... [Roberto Fresca, Grull Osgo]

U.N. Defense Force: Earth Joker (US / Japan, set 3) [Sergio G]

-Found in Taito PCB: K1100726A / J1100169B [Sergio G]

-It only differs in 2 program roms: 4.ic23 and 3.ic8. They are very close to earthjkra set and only differs in 42 bytes in each rom.
 [Sergio G]

-Eprom labels are numbered in the same way as earthjkrp set, but 3 and 4 ones are swapped (Maybe a typo in earthjkrp ?) [Sergio G]

-Same ROMSTAR license and no region disclaimer when dipswitch is changed, like earthjkr and earthjkra sets. [Sergio G]

-It seems a newer version than earthjkra set, including additional changes to those added in earthjkra in comparison to earthjkr
 set, as earthjkra and earthjkrb share the same changes from earthjkr. [Sergio G]

-Added new clone: earthjkb in mame.lst [Sergio G]
