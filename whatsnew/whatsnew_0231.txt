7869: New BSD-licensed OPL/OPLL (YM3526, YM3812, YM2413, Y8950, YMF262, etc) cores [aaronsgiles]
* Expanded ymfm.cpp to support OPL/OPLL
* Major refactoring of ymfm.cpp code to accommodate new features and multiple families
* OPLL cores (ym2413, ds1001, etc) now load instrument data from external ROMs
* Optimized performance through pre-caching and early exits
* Added helpers to convert to/from internal FP format; updated tmnt sound to use them

7870: twinkle.cpp: Add partial dumps for Twinkle 1stStyle and Substream variants [DragonMinded]
Add dumps taken from actual hardware for 1stStyle and Substream variants that use the X76F041 for the dongle. This is not strictly
  necessary to play the games as it turns out that the game binaries have a bug where they call strcmp on the data returned from the
  dongle but don't check the return code. Therefore, the only thing actually "protecting" these versions from piracy is a dongle
  which returns "password okay" and any 8 bytes of data from a dongle. This is why Substream variants which have no dongle dump
  still returned "OK" in the security portion of the startup.
Still, I've dumped all dongle variants that I have access to and updated the romsets accordingly. They are marked "BAD_DUMP" because
  its not possible to recover the write or config password, nor the config registers without the config password. Therefore, the
  config registers have been inferred from unused code found in the Substream program CD which initializes a dongle and configures
  the registers. See the note I added in the code for more detail. I've left that there so a future dumper that has access to an
  exploit or can decap and read the registers somehow knows what info is missing and why they're marked "BAD_DUMP". Updated zip
  files will be sent to code@ as well.
While I was at it, I updated the known software list to include beatstage II 2nd Style. This was a version created for Korea
  specifically and video of the splash screen shows it to be unique. I have no additional info, so hopefully a dump will surface
  some day.

7878: cdrom: Return index 1/start of track data instead of index 0/start of pregap data [987123879113]
Stumbled on a related bug with the way pregap is added to the TOC while trying to fix CDDA audio issues in Firebeat and System 573.
MAME vs Duckstation (both using the same CHD):
!image
Results on real PS1:
!image
Results with this patch applied:
!image
I came up with a simple test program that uses `CdGetToc` and `CdPosToInt` to display the reported MSF and LBA values. Although this
  change will affect everything that uses cdrom.cpp, I chose the PS1 emulator for testing because I am able to reproduce the bug I'm
  hunting down using the PS1's CD player functionality in the BIOS.
Testing method for MAME and Duckstation:
1) Load test program cdtester.chd
2) Change disc using file menu from cdtester.chd to a different CHD, in this case a custom CHD named 845jba02.chd
3) Press button which calls `CdGetToc` and `CdPosToInt` on the currently inserted CD and display the results
Same for real PS1 except the CD is switched out for step 2.
845jba02.chd is a CHD made from a CloneCD dump converted to bin/toc. This is what the actual track listing looks like according to
  the CHD:

7916: Change audio_latency valid range from 1-5 to 0-5 [987123879113]
Currently with MAME 0.230, if `audio_latency` of 0 is specified then you will get the error `Out-of-range integer value for
  audio_latency: "0" (must be between 1 and 5, inclusive); reverting to 2` after
  https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/d578fa07444ef8744e9c2c569b49ab1ca0ed11a3 which re-enabled validations.
pasound uses `audio_latency` = 0 to mean "very-low-latency" mode:
  https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/30371b5717b3aa88da7f3d19235821f7eca0d429/src/osd/modules/sound/pa_sound.cpp#L264-L273
CoreAudio and SDL already clamp to 1-5. DirectSound and XAudio2 don't do anything but their calculations would probably break if set
  to 0 so I've added code to clamp those to 1 as well.

7921: fmtowns: fix off-by-1 calculation in CDDA length [rzero9]
The changes in commit 2caa566f22606682ee432c410d40376335e12b02 have exposed an existing miscalculation that is currently causing a
  few Data West games (psydet3/4, shamhat, maybe others) to hang at the initial logo.
Basically what's happening is: the "play CDDA" CD controller command uses the start point and end point as parameters, but MAME's
  CDDA device needs the total amount of sectors to play, so the "end LBA - start LBA" calculation makes it stop one sector before it
  should. This change fixes it by adding 1 to the total.

7924: Update Dutch strings.po [mourix]
Added all missing strings for the Dutch language.
Also made spelling and meanings more consistent after testing the menu's with previous translations.

7925: Fix vs2019_clang build [vadosnaprimer]
A `vs2019_clang` build is quite a bit faster than `vs2019`, so it has value too. From my observations, the speed of `vs2019_clang`
  is the same as of a GCC build, while its size is _more than twice_ smaller.

7944: Adding technical details on the SVP chip internal ROM and fixing start address [jdesiloniz]
Related to https://github.com/mamedev/mame/issues/7910
This PR adds a bit of technical detail on the internal ROM that I found in the SVP chip on what parts of it are actually used during
  the boot-up process of Virtua Racing. Also I fixed the addresses where this ROM should be in the internal memory map. (Note: I
  don't have the means to test this thoroughly right now, but I think that moving the start address for the ROM loading should do
  the trick).
I'm not sure if there's any process that it's distinguishing between internal and external views from the DSP to the ROM space
  (i.e.: when accessing ROM space from external registers you should see the actual game ROM data, not the internal ROM - caveat: I
  haven't tested this yet but I can try to do a quick test in real hardware at some point if you want me to). This should't affect
  Virtua Racing's behavior though, as that area in its ROM is totally empty.
I haven't linked the wiki I have for the internal ROM with the full disassembly and more details (accessible here:
  https://github.com/jdesiloniz/svpdev/wiki/Internal-ROM) as it felt SPAMmy to me. But if you feel it's worth it I can add it in a
  separate commit.

7953: Add Franklin ACE 1000 as a clone of the Apple ][+ [christopherkobayashi]
Hello,
The Franklin ACE 1000 was a popular clone of the Apple ][+.  The differences were:
* a more complicated color video generator,
* built-in lowercase support (so different character generator ROM and a few other ROM changes),
* slightly modified ROMs
I own two ACE 1000s.  I've dumped the ROMs (attached) and added an "ace1000" target to the apple2 driver.
Would it be possible to merge these changes into the main repository?
Thanks,
-- Chris

7961: nb1412m2: Fixed Mighty Guy some sound issues [sasuke-arcade]
Fixed various sound issues in Mighty Guy so that it sounds almost exactly like PCB.
- Fixed BGM tempo was unstable.
  - The frequency setting of DAC and timer clock are now linked.
  - When changes the DAC clock, Sound driver set wait loop count ($C010) in the range of 2 to 4 in order to keep the tempo of BGM
  even if changed clock. This was the cause of the slow BGM in previous versions.
- Fixed DAC clock calculation.
  - I changed this so that sound plays same as PCB.
- Implemented a protect command 0x11 to stop the DAC.
  - This is needed to stop DAC sound when the psycho gun is stopped.

7964: laserbat.cpp: Quantise area effect 2/shell to 4-pixel intervals for catnmous. [cuavas]
According to this page and this photo in particular, there’s a wire mod on at least some Cat'n'Mouse boards to pull up pins 8, 9, 10
  and 11 on IC13I.  This would have the effect of quantising area effect 2/shell to 4-pixel intervals.
How plausible does it seem that the boards would have all left the factory with this mod?  They *were* using a wire mod for sprite
  banking.
(The rest of the change is just tidying up the driver a little.)

7968: CM-32P: support PCM cards, add U-110 card softlist [ValleyBell]
This PR adds support for PCM ROM cards to the CM-32P driver.
With the SN-U110-04 card inserted, the CM-32P driver finally passes the PCM ROM test. (number 3)
A softlist for all currently dumped cards is included.
The CM-32P uses the PCM cards initially made for the U-110. Thus I named the softlist `u110_card`.
Known issues:
- Inserting a PCM card currently restarts the (emulated) CM-32P machine.
  On the actual device, you can just insert and eject the cards without a reboot. It works more like floppies.
  However I couldn't get MAME to treat the PCM card slot similar to a floppy drive.
- Selecting the PCM cards from the softlist doesn't seem to work properly.
  MAME detects that the files are there, restarts, and then exits with e.g.  
  `Fatal error: Device Generic Cartridge Slot load (-cartridge u110_card:sn-u110-04:card) failed: File not found`
  Running `mame -verifysoftlist u110_card` reports that all romsets are good.

7979: cyclemb.cpp: Improve input, sound, display, flip screen, and dip switches [sasuke-arcade]
- Support for correct input of Cycle Maaboh roller controller.
  - Previous inputs did not correctly. This made it impossible to clear stage 3 and later, which requires roller inputs.
- Fixed possibly incorrect handling of sound latch.
  - Fixed issue where Cycle Maaboh would not play the stage music.
  - Previously, Sound latch was overwritten by command for getting input.
- Support I/O input for hiding screen.
  - Screen switching at start of a stage is now correct.
- Fixed position of tilemap in flip screen of Cycle Maaboh.
- Added support for Sky Destroyer flipscreen.
- Fixed dipswitches.
  - Removed definition of unused bits for non-dipswitch inputs.
  - Added some dipswitch definitions.
- Implemented work RAM switching for sprites.
  - Games on this board used to switch two sprite work RAM and doublebuffered it. This implementation fixes sprites frame rate was
  being half.
Concerns
- Sky Destroyer flips screen when "Flip Screen" dipswitch bit is OFF (In this driver, dipswitch bit and flip On/Off are reversed).
  This dip switch works only in Cocktail mode. Uplight mode ignores this and always flips the screen. In this case, should the
  driver draw the screen inverted?

This update contains the following two patches:
1. Fix display issues with mixed mode (graphics/text)
2. Add support for DMAW and DMAR commands
The first patch will fix the display bugs in the second bitmap graphics test on the QX10 diagnostics disk. It also for the same
  reason fixes the VALDOCS menu system on the QX10.
The second patch adds DMA support to the upd7220. I tested this again using the QX10 diagnostics disk and both the DMA write and DMA
  read test now behave as expected.

7987: segas16a/sega16b tweaks [DavidHaywood]
- change when video is updated (for fantzone)
- bump quantum time for 16a cases with MCU (for quartet stage 18)
the Fantasy Zone fix was suggested by PhilB back in 2012 here https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=1852 and after discussion in the
  shoutbox it seemed the general consensus was to just go with it, rather than trying to complicate things with more complex code
  using a timer to latch values, which could give the impression that it had been measured, despite not having any evidence for the
  PCB timing.  I've applied it to segas16b too as the platforms are very similar, and if there's an issue with this to suggest
  different timing it's more likely to show up with more test cases.
the quantum boost is for quartet, I noticed after fixing the MCU hookup some months ago that certain stages on the protected sets
  (very noticeable on stage 18) had glitchy background scroll every few seconds, it appears to fix that.

7989: travrusa.cpp - hold vblank interrupt for the whole of the vblank period [DavidHaywood]
travrusa.cpp - hold vblank interrupt for the whole of the vblank period allowing it to retrigger in some cases - improves shtrider

  I've tested travrusa with these changes and didn't notice any new issues.

7992: stfight.cpp: Remove YM2203 frequency hack, and set prescaler at machine_start [sasuke-arcade]
testers-03911:   stfight,  empcity: Music pitch is too low
Empire City: 1931 implements a hack that 3x YM2203 clock frequency in order to solve the all sounds too low pitch. But FM (BGM) be
  correct, but SSG (timer countdown, clear bonus count) is still low pitch.
Frequency hack can't seem to get the correct pitch.
This PR removes frequency hack and sets YM2203 clock prescaler at machine_start in order to get right pitch.
This fix may be a hack-like approach, but I proposed the PR in this because this can remove hack that result in wrong pitch.

7995: upd7220: fix copy paste bug in DMA handling [brijohn]
Fixes copy paste bug in upd7220 DMA handling, also fixed up coding style to be consistent with the rest of the upd7220.cpp file.

7996: tweaks to the funkyjet addition, also apply single pixel video offset to match hardware [DavidHaywood]
tweaks to the funkyjet addition, also apply single pixel video offset to match hardware videos and correct bg / sprite alignment.
I've also tagged the sample ROM in the other sets as BAD_DUMP pending verification, it definitely looks suspicious compared to the
  one in the new set.
I've marked the addition as a 'prototype?' rather than alternate demo, because there are many, many more changes than just the demo.

-New BSD-licensed OPL/OPLL (YM3526, YM3812, YM2413, Y8950, YMF262, etc) cores (#7869) [Aaron Giles]
 * OPL prep. Define FAMILY constant in register classes, and use that instead of template specialization for family-specific
    behaviors. Expand channel masks to 32 bits. Add is_keyon() helper.
 * Made FM channel and operator mapping more flexible. Operators are now owned by the engine and can be dynamically assigned to
    channels. Register classes now provide a mapping between a linear set of operators and channels. The register data array is now
    a regular array instead of a vector.
 * Minor change for consistency.
 * Introduce OPL registers and create a ymopl_engine. Add support for sustain-less notes and the OPL envelope clocks (which does not
    divide by 3).
 * Moved keycode calculations into register class. Removed unnecessary recalc in phase generator. Lined up OPL frequency, feedback,
    algorithm, and total level.
 * Implement key scale level and OPL-specific LFO and phase handling.
 * Create new YM3526 device based on new OPL. Fix keyon and sustain behaviors.
 * Fix weird OPL multiple values. Clean up and further document OPL LFO.
 * No busy flag on OPL, so no need to do the work. Add a right shift of 1 to the output stage to line up volume with old
    implementation.
 * More compact way of representing key scale level values.
 * Move the KSL bitswap into the registers since it's apparently fixed in OPLL and perhaps others.
 * Add support for ryhthm generation in OPL. Change compute_volume to take a phase value directly, and expose operator phase.
 * Fix OPL timers.
 * Start LFSR with a non-zero value to ensure it actually starts generating for OPL.
 * Fix silly bug in sustain logic for OPL. Fixes a lot of previously missing sounds.
 * Create OPL2 engine. Add waveform support for OPL2/3 waveforms.
 * Wire up YM3812 to the new OPL2 engine.
 * Reset OPL timers when the mask is written as well.
 * Manage rhythm key ons separately. Fixes Wardner awfulness.
 * Explicitly make channel logic handle 0, 2, or 4 operators rather than checking each one for null. Also simplify the combining
    logic for the 2 operator case.
 * Reverse bit order of LFSRs to make things a little simpler. Fix OPL LFSR so that it has its full 23-bit period.
 * Change outputs along the path to arrays rather than stereo items. This allows for four channel output. Also add a constant for
    the number of outputs to the register class.
 * Move status register bit definitions to the registers class. Generically support the IRQ bit.
 * Create shared helpers for FP encode/decode/roundtrip and use them throughout. Also update TMNT to use the FP decoder.
 * No need to clamp when using the roundtrip.
 * Clear the EOS flag when execute is turned off on ADPCM-B. Fix combine_status in YM2608 to ignore previously set flags.
 * Add missing note_select in base class. Don't add 1 to the OPL release rate.
 * Move Y8950 over to new OPL engine.
 * Remove old y8950, along with fmopl and ymdeltat
 * Add updates prior to status reads for ADPCM systems.
 * Add status_mask and irq_reset logic into the core. Clean up documentation on family-specific registers. Includes some temporary
    gross debugging stuff.
 * Made debugging less gross by giving operators and channels a reference back to their owner.
 * Fix status port address in OPL chips. Reduce ADPCM volume to match previous implementation.
 * Fix Y8950 ADPCM start. Return masked status properly.
 * Initial cut at OPLL mapping.
 * Add YM2413 support based on ymfm; renamed vrc7snd to ds1001; added YM2423 amd YMF281 variants as well. Instrument data is now
    loaded via external ROMs. Added 'depress' envelope support to the core engine. Fixed a number of issues in the ymopll_engine.
    Documented hard-coded values. Moved register clear into register-specific reset.
 * Add missing identifier.
 * Y8950 is OPL not OPL2.
 * Some documentation cleanup. Consistency fixes in the register classes.
 * Consolidate large comments. Add support for delayed modulators for OPL. Broke out 2-op and 4-op cases to help simplify logic.
    Fixed overflow handling in fp encoding.
 * Fix silly bug.
 * Changed operator assignment mechanism to be more readable. Added prepare method to be called at the start of sound update. Added
    ALL_CHANNELS constant to register files. Updated all consumers to call prepare and use constants where applicable.
 * Move YMF262 and YMF278B to use new FM engine for OPL3/4. Fix several issues in OPL3 logic, which now seems to work ok.
 * Minor fixes. More documentation.
 * Fix MSVC build.
 * Add caching of data to prepare methods to improve performance. Moved non-register decoding logic out of the .h file and into .cpp
    file. Move phase_step calculation into register class.
 * More notes. Removed keycode from cache. Split 2/4-operator outputs into separate functions. Changed OPN/OPL to use templates for
    variants. Added channel/operator_offset helpers.
 * Fairly substantial overhaul of register interface. Register interface is now stateless and contains family-specific state.
    Channel and operator accessors are prefixed by ch_/op_ now and require an offset to the specific channel or operator. Moved
    LFO/noise generation into register class, along with keyon logging.
 * Add noise back to OPL/OPLL
 * Added early-out for low envelope. Moved waveform logic out into family-specific code. General clean up of ordering. Reduced
    family base class to minimal needed.
 * More aggressively track active channels to help performance.
 * Use only summing outputs for consideration of active channels. Centralize the logic of determined 4-op vs 2-op.
 * More conservative channel deactivation.
 * Add helper to compute the sample rate and use it in all implementations. Remove unneeded chnum/opnum members.
 * Fix error in YM2612 that caused crashes.
 * Switching parameters and locals to 32-bit values gives a noticeable performance boost. Checkpoint 1.
 * More moving to 32-bit values. Checkpoint 2.
 * Last of the 32-bit promotions.
 * Ensure SSG inverted flag is only tested on systems with SSG support in the innermost loops.
 * Make most constants 32-bit as well. Expose some constants via the engine class.
 * Expand waveforms ahead of time. Optimize the attenuation lookup a bit.
 * If volume is low, don't erase output, just leave it alone. Fixes missing sound in raimais.
 * Replace a couple of magic numbers with constants.
 * Normalization of FM engine usage across consumers.
 * Removed explicit external prepare() call; this logic is now automatically done after writes and periodically. Changed OPL/OPLL to
    use native formats for block/fnum. Fixed waveform generation. Fixed PM and AM depth on OPL/OPLL.
 * Cache multiple value. Clean up output handling a bit.
 * Move multiple caching ahead of phase step caching.
 * Fully split OPLL from OPL. Remove many hacks now that OPLL registers can have state. Created shared helpers between OPL/OPLL.
    Removed more aggressive channel disables since it was not rhythm friendly and didn't really buy much.
 * Remove old comment
 * Remove bad write in OPL mode case. Fixes fsoccer intro. Only call set_reset_status() once per mode call.
 * Remove FM output boost in YM2608/2610. Not sure why I did that. Better matches previous volume now.
 * Make AM/PM logging less confusing.
 * Let's actually set DYNAMIC_OPS properly, eh?
 * Improved logging.
 * Comment cleanups. Add constant for dynamic phase. Pre-shift sustain level. Srcclean.
 * Fix memory regions on YM2608 games.
 * Clean up ymadpcm to line up with recent ymfm changes.
 * y8950: Reshuffle read/write handlers. Rename them to less confusing names.
 * ym2413: Reshuffle read/write handlers. Rename them to less confusing names.
 * ym3526/ym3812: Reshuffle read/write handlers. Rename them to less confusing names.
 * ymf262: Match read/write details to datasheet and previous tests.
 * Use a constexpr function instead of macro for packing operator numbers. Pre-compute OPM LFO waveforms.
 * Generate OPL4 engine to support the proper clock divider and new flags. Update YMF278B to use FM timers and status rather than
    replicating the logic.
 * Fix 4-operator enable on new OPL4 instance.
 * Fix FM downsampling and adjust balance in YM278B.

-nb1412m2: Fixed some Mighty Guy sound issues (#7961) [sasuke-arcade]
 * Fixed various sound issues in Mighty Guy so that it sounds almost exactly like PCB.
   - Fixed BGM tempo was unstable. The frequency setting of DAC and timer clock are now linked. When changes the DAC clock, Sound
      driver set wait loop count ($C010) in the range of 2 to 4 in order to keep the tempo of BGM even if changed clock. This was
      the cause of the slow BGM in previous versions.
   - Fixed DAC clock calculation. I changed this so that sound plays same as PCB.
   - Implemented a protect command 0x11 to stop the DAC. This is needed to stop DAC sound when the psycho gun is stopped.
