-netlist: add MOSFET model. [Couriersud]
 * added MOSFET model. Currently capacitances are not modelled. This is a 3-pin model (Bulk connected to Source) with provisions to
    extend it to 4-pin at a later stage.
 * Add a capacitor generic model which is charge conserving. Switch netlist to use this model instead of constant capacity model.
 * Start putting constants into a central place.
 * Please expect minor timing differences due to a different numerical path. The cmos inverter example illustrates the analog
    implementation of a cmos inverter gate. These were used a lot back in the 70s/80s to generate sinus waves. The model should also
    be able to better emulate 4066 analog switches. The addition of a relatively simple capacitor model is planned at a later stage.
    Expect everything from the MOSFET model at the current stage. Wrong results as well as convergence issues and crashes.

-netlist: Improved MOS transistor model. [Couriersud]
 * This is a significant improvement to the MOS transistor model. It adds modelling of the Meyer capacitance model. This is a
    somewhat academic addition since the effects occur on a nanosecond time scale and have a huge impact on performance. I plan to
    make the capacitance model selectable. Both on a model level as well as by introducing a global solver parameter. The model
    delivers comparable results to LTSpice.

-netlist: Timing bug fix. Affects regression tests. [Couriersud]
 * This fixes a rounding issue in the ptime code. This bug surfaced when I tested netlist with picosecond resolution in ptime. This
    will have a small impact on every driver using netlist. For breakout, it required to adjust the color overlay.

 * The kungfu master schematics differ from the kidnik schematics in wiring D4, D5 and Q4 with other components. The manual
    corrections to the kungfu master schematics make sense and thus are used here.
 * opamp XU1.B according to schematics has no feedback loop between output and inputs. The arrangement of components in the
    schematic however indicate that this is not the case and indeed a connection exists. This results in sounds at output XU1.14 to
    contain more detail.
