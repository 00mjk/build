 MCU dump patched from the decapped sqixu MCU, using hints in the bootleg

    unique device id. This allows the osd layer when creating a device to
    pass a friendly display name along with a unique identifier.
 * Currently the device id is only used to map a physical controller device
    to controller id, but can be used more generally in the future. For raw
    input devices, we use the full raw input name as the device id. For all
    other devices, we fall back to device name as the device id. The
    "uniqueness" of the device id is not currently enforced in code.
