 * gunpey.cpp : Minor cleanups, Fix object finder, Convert VRAM into std::unique_ptr, Fix bit manipulations
 * gunpey.cpp : Revert "Fix bit manipulations"
 * gunpey.cpp : Cleanup duplicates

-atpci.cpp: move m55hi-plus motherboard stuff to a new machine called m55hipl [Samuele Zannoli]

-Sarayan made me do it. [Vas Crabb]
 * Concrete device types now have a call operator that instantiates a device.
 * This change means you *must* use DECLARE_DEVICE_TYPE to declare the public interface of your device, even if it's device_t.  If
    you want to use private implementation classes, use DEFINE_DEVICE_TYPE_PRIVATE and instantiate the object finders.

-c6280.cpp : Fix LFO [cam900]
 * <<1 is same at patent, not +1 (reference:https://patents.google.com/patent/US4924744A/)

 * Allow AES joystick to be connected to arcade systems with D-sub connectors (common for "consolised" use)
 * Pass through Select input from D-sub connectors on JAMMA variants
 * Default to Japan BIOS for fixed software using mahjong panel (Euro BIOS doesn't support mahjong panel)
 * Use JAMMA joystick panel for mahretsu since (doesn't support mahjong panel in MVS mode)
 * Allow controls to be changed for MVS mahjong games (only BIOS and bakatono support joysticks, but still useful)

-neogeo: give the single-slog JAMMA variants parent-clone relationships [Vas Crabb]

-amstrad: allow for loading CPR cartridges with odd numbers of blocks [mahlemiut]

-Updated Greek Translation [BraiNKilleRGR]

 * adc0808: Reduced CPU overhead by smarter timer usage. [Ryan Holtz]

-amstrad: restore CPR bank mask, force it to be based on the size of an actual ROM [mahlemiut]

-Update Dutch language strings (#3499) [Jos van Mourik]

-Set finder tag relative to current device being configured rather than the finder's owner.  This meand you no longer need to care
 about the your relationship to the object being configured and a lot of ^ and : can disappear.  There's a bit reduction in string
 pasting in macros from this. [Vas Crabb]
 * Yes, I have to make this apply to devcb etc. as well, but that's a job for another day.
 * There's probably at least one thing broken by this where optional objects are involved.  Most things can be solved by just
    getting rid of the now-problematic ^ and : prefixes.

-Bind devcb relative to current device.  This is probably going to break plenty of things with late bind errors.  Sorry. [Vas Crabb]
 * Remaining things to switch over include sound routes and things with custom delegates.

-Get rid of the assert replacement.  It prevents you from using assert in a destructor for a literal type due to the implicit
 nothrow.  It's just not worth the trouble it's causing. [Vas Crabb]
 * In file included from ../../../../../src/emu/emu.h:83: ../../../../../src/emu/mconfig.h:70:5: error: '~token' has a non-throwing
    exception specification but can still throw [-Werror,-Wexceptions] assert(m_device == m_host.m_current_device); ^ In file
    included from ../../../../../src/emu/emu.h:29: ../../../../../src/emu/emucore.h:230:48: note: expanded from macro 'assert'
    #define assert(x)               do { if (!(x)) throw emu_fatalerror("assert: %s:%d: %s", __FILE__, __LINE__, #x); } while (0) ^
    In file included from ../../../../../src/emu/emu.h:83: ../../../../../src/emu/mconfig.h:66:3: note: destructor has a implicit
    non-throwing exception specification ~token() ^ 1 error generated.

-Updated translation for Brazilian Portuguese [Wellington Uemura]

-Fixes in SL ROM names (leading and trailing spaces) (#3501) [Wintermute 0110]
 * Fix ROM name (remove trailing space).
 * Fix trailing spaces in ROM name.
 * Fix trailing spaces in ROM names.
 * Fix leading spaces in ROM names.

-pc9801.cpp: dumped kanji roms for PC9801VM [Fujix, hiromasha]

-Correct Pop'n Music 2, Pop'n Music 3 year [sjy96525]
 * Pop'n Music 2, Pop'n Music 3 titlescreens says 1999, and Pop'n Music 2 was released in April 1999, Pop'n Music 3 was released in
    September 1999.

-Route sound relative to current device. [Vas Crabb]
 * Also, look Ma - no magic prologue!
 * Slot card additions run in the context of the slot itself, which isn't entirely intuitive.  Slot configuration needs a bunch of
    other cleanup anyway.

-Fix Lode Runner SG1000/SC-3000 ROM image detection [Kalevi Kolttonen]
 * At least on Fedora Linux 27, the following happened when not using XML-files:
 * mame sc3000 -window -cart /usr/share/mame/roms/sc3000/mpr-5998.ic1 Ignoring MAME exception: Unknown slot option 'codemasters' in
    slot 'slot' Unknown slot option 'codemasters' in slot 'slot'
 * I suppose that was because Lode Runner ROM image was not correctly detected. This patch adds a special case to detect Lode Runner
    (Japan, Europe).

-chasehq, topspeed: dumped motor CPU ROM and added detailed hardware description for chasehq [Guru]

-holeland.cpp: documentend pals for crzrallyg [f205v]

-igs017.cpp: Emulated the protection in iqblocka, iqblockf, genius6 [Luca Elia]

-mcs51: Add more interrupt and timer registers to debug state [AJR]

-stvvdp2.cpp: ROZ fixes for Radiant SilverGun Xiga stage: [Angelo Salese]
 * support for line windows;
 * undocumented behaviour: Rotation Parameter read control seems to mirror/have a correlation in the subsequent register;

-stvvdp2.cpp: don't repeat ROZ when screen over process is equal to 1, fixes D-Xhird practice stage [Angelo Salese]

-stvvdp2.cpp: implemented vertical cell scroll (Sonic Jam) [Angelo Salese]

-Allow devcb to be bound to a device/mixin or the target of a device finder.  This works outside machine configuration context so
 the workarounds in ATA HLE and MSX slots are no longer necessary.  It also allows reduction in tag repetition in machine
 configuration (see converted osborne1.cpp, zorba.cpp or the more extreme tranz330.cpp). [Vas Crabb]
 * Allow reimagined device instantiation to take a device finder based on current device being configured to reduce repetition (see
    tranz330.cpp).

-tms9914: improved emulation. HPIB test of IPC diagb ROM now passes. [fulivi]

-Update German Translation (#3509) [Raf Tacker]

-stvvdp2.cpp: fixed potential bug with window Y sizes when double density interlace is enabled [Angelo Salese]

-asteroid: Swap start LEDs and suppress logging for many spurious writes [AJR]

-Make MCFG_DEVICE_ADD and callable device types more flexible: [Vas Crabb]
 * Allows defaulted clocks (see subtle example with vboy)
 * Allows additional constructors (see RS232 port in tranz330)
 * Allows use of device finder in place of tag in MCFG_DEVICE_ADD
 * Requires out-of-line destructor for devices using incomplete types
 * Requires XTAL or explicit u32 for clocks for devices with private types
 * Devices must still define the standard constructor.  When writing additional constructors, be aware that the constructor runs
    before device_add_mconfig in the context of the existing device, not the new device.  See osborne1, zorba, tranz330, and vboy
    for examples of this in use.  Compilation is a bit slower, but this is temporary while refactoring is in progress.
 * Eliminated the need for MCFG_SOUND_ROUTE_EX.
 * Removed macros from slot option configuration - they just obfuscated code and slowed it down with needless dynamic casts, but
    didn't actually simplify it.

-rohga.cpp Update [cam900]
 * rohga.cpp : Fix background color of title screen in wolffang

-new NOT WORKING [DavidHaywood]

-bbcm512: Added mouse, and promoted to working. [Nigel Barnes]
 * bbcmaiv: Added tracker ball.

-cit101: Somewhat major improvements [AJR]
 * High level emulation of serial keyboard (only sort of works; probably should be less sophisticated)
 * Add double height and double width attributes
 * Adjustable start of screen pointer (necessary for SET-UP mode)
 * Reconfigure screen for 80/132-column and 50/60 Hz modes
 * dikeyboard: Add scan_complete callback (nw, sort of hacky but cit101 keyboard works worse without it)

-start looking at the extra opcodes in the SSD 2000 type XaviX chip (s… (#3514) [David Haywood]
 * start looking at the extra opcodes in the SSD 2000 type XaviX chip (seems some undocumented 6502 opcodes are replaced with more
    custom ones)

-MT06960 fix [AJR]

-Streamline machine configuration macros - everyone's a device edition. [Vas Crabb]
 * Start replacing special device macros with additional constructors, starting with ISA, INTELLEC 4 and RS-232 buses.
 * Allow an object finder to take on the target of another object finder.
 * (For a combination of the previous two things in action, see either the INTELLEC 4 driver, or the Apple 2 PC Exporter card.  Also
    check out looping over a device finder array to instantiate devices in some places.  Lots of things no longer need to pass tags
    around.)
 * Start supplying default clocks for things that have a standard clock or have all clocks internal.
 * Eliminate the separate DEV versions of the DEVCB_ macros.  Previously, the plain versions were a shortcut for DEVICE_SELF as the
    target.  You can now supply a string tag (relative to current device being configured), an object finder (takes on the base and
    relative tag), or a reference to a device/interface (only do this if you know the device won't be replaced out from under it,
    but that's a safe assumption for your subdevices).  In almost all cases, you can get the effect you want by supplying *this as
    the target.
 * Eliminate sound and CPU versions of macros.  They serve no useful purpose, provide no extra checks, make error messages longer,
    add indirection, and mislead newbies into thinking there's a difference.
 * Remove a lot of now-unnecessary ":" prefixes binding things relative to machine root.
 * Clean up some miscellaneous rot.
 * Examples of new functionality in use in (some more subtle than others):
 * src/mame/drivers/intellec4.cpp
 * src/mame/drivers/tranz330.cpp
 * src/mame/drivers/osboren1.cpp
 * src/mame/drivers/zorba.cpp
 * src/mame/devices/smioc.cpp

-tms32031: add tms320c30 and basic hold/holda support [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * For some reason there was no TMS320C30 device, so it's been added. Stubbed in basic HOLD/HOLDA line/callback support which is
    used to suspend DSP external bus access, and used by the InterPro EDGE graphics boards under development. This change doesn't
    actually change the 'C30 behaviour yet, but allows the external device to get an acknowledgement and proceed.

 * Allow palette to be specified to GFXDECODE as a device finder
 * Removed diserial.h from emu.h as it's used relatively infrequently
 * Also fix darkseal and vaportra propely.  The palette device automatically attaches itself to a share with matching tag.  The
    correct solution here is to rename one or the other out of the way, since it was never attached to a share before.

-Improve simulated protection comms in banbam, mark MCU dump as good. Based from observations and Phil's comments on MAMEWorld the
 SUN 8212 dump should be absolutely good, no doubts from me about it. Actual MCU hookup will come later but in the meantime I've
 fixed up the fake protection kludge as a placeholder. [kazblox]

-senjyo.cpp : Simpler starforc bg color swap [cam900]

-remote488: checkpointing added Hi, [fulivi]
 * this commit adds a synchronization mechanism to ieee-488 remotizer. It relies on "checkpoints": both ends of the link can insert
    a "checkpoint" msg at the end of a byte string and wait for it to be reflected back as "checkpoint reached" msg. This way the
    sender of the string knows when the receiver has somehow "consumed" the whole string. The need for synchronization comes from
    the need to implement the "unbuffered read" command of the Amigo protocol which is used by the hp9k/3xx series of machines. As
    soon as this PR is closed, I'll publish an update to my amigo_drive utility to keep it aligned with the remotizer. Thanks.

-Removed DRIVER_INIT-related macros, made driver init entry in GAME/COMP/CONS explicit. This change removes the DRIVER_INIT-related
 macros and makes driver initialization more explicit: It's simply a void function, so we now declare and define the initialization
 functions as such. [MooglyGuy]
 * The hope is that the driver init entry will go away entirely, as the bulk of its functionality can simply be moved into
    machine_start. This will be part of my next round of changes.
 * This PR addresses the feedback provided by Olivier on the first PR.
 * Since I effectively had to touch every GAME(L) / CONS / COMP(L) / SYST macro in the codebase, I also took the opportunity to - in
    most cases - apply more consistent and reasonable spacing to the macros. This is primarily why I have submitted this as a PR
    rather than just committing directly to master, because I realize it will be a very contentious change.

-start looking at the extra opcodes in the SSD 2000 type XaviX chip (seems some undocumented 6502 opcodes are replaced with more
 custom ones) [DavidHaywood]

-tms9914: improved emulation Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR is for a small change to tms9914 emulation. This change allows the HPIB test in IPC diagnostic ROM to pass. HPIB test can
    be started by running IPC with "diagb" BIOS option. Once the screen has filled with messages from the RAM test, press F1 to
    interrupt the test sequence, then press F4 to run the HPIB test. Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-fmtowns.cpp : Accurate sound outputs fmtowns.cpp : Accurate sound outputs from real hardware (real one has seperated left/right
 audio out (supports stereo)) [cam900]

-Fix typo in translation [RafTacker]

-Update German Translation [RafTacker]

-Fix Lode Runner SG1000/SC-3000 ROM image detection At least on Fedora Linux 27, the following happened when not using XML-files:
 [KaleviKolttonen]
 * mame sc3000 -window -cart /usr/share/mame/roms/sc3000/mpr-5998.ic1 Ignoring MAME exception: Unknown slot option 'codemasters' in
    slot 'slot' Unknown slot option 'codemasters' in slot 'slot'
 * I suppose that was because Lode Runner ROM image was not correctly detected. This patch adds a special case to detect Lode Runner
    (Japan, Europe).

-highvdeo.cpp Updates highvdeo.cpp : Cleanup drawing (related by cliprect), Split machine config and address map per each games,
 Cleanup Duplicates, Add output finder, Cleanup ROM loading, Add notes, Add precalculated color for game with drawing directly
 RGB565, Remove unnecessary things [cam900]

-Fix Acorn SL names so they show in the right position in front-ends. In MAME it is customary to write computer names (machine
 names) without any brand at the beginning. For example: **Playstation** and not **Sony Playstation**. However, in SLs the brand
 name at the beginning is customary and I think it makes sense so SL appear in the right position in front-ends. [Wintermute0110]
 * In this PR I have fixed some Acorn BBC/ABC SL names. If PR is accepted and merged then I will correct some other SL names
    (Sinclair, etc.).

-Correct Pop'n Music 2, Pop'n Music 3 years Pop'n Music 2, Pop'n Music 3 titlescreens says 1999, and Pop'n Music 2 was released in
 April 1999, Pop'n Music 3 was released in September 1999. [sjy96525]

-Added real alternative systems cocoh, cocoeh, coco2h, and coco2bh These real alternative systems have the upgraded HD6309E CPU in
 them. [drencorxeen]
 * The code that has been added was tested working in the official 0197 mame sources without problem.

-Fixed the coco3dw1 system as it was missing the CART_CB WRITELINE, NMI… This pull request is to fix the missing code that would
 allow the WD1773 to work properly with the CPU. [drencorxeen]
 * Without the code the emulated system would crash when accessing FDC images.
 * Added the missing code and tested the system.

-rad_eu3a14 - improve rendering for rad_foot by making more correct use of sprite registers / bits … [DavidHaywood]

-aica.cpp Document updates aica.cpp : Correct register name from development manual, Add docs of unimplemented registers; Add
 imperfect_features because Emulation isn't perfect (DSP, etc..) [cam900]

-hp_ipc: HPIB interface Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR adds the HPIB interface (aka IEEE-488) to the HP Integral PC. It also adds a remotizer device to the bus so that the IPC
    can interface externally-emulated HP drives (see, for example, my amigo_drive utility in this repository). Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-Correct spcewars romset In MAME 0.36b16 spcewars was added to the 8080bw.c driver: [MASHinfo]
 * ROM_START( spcewars ) ROM_REGION( 0x10000, REGION_CPU1 )     /* 64k for code */ ROM_LOAD( "sanritsu.1",   0x0000, 0x0400,

    0x1c00, 0x0400, 0x64fdc3e1 ) ROM_LOAD( "sanritsu.9",   0x4000, 0x0400, 0xb2f29601 ) ROM_END
 * GAME( 1978, spcewars, invaders, invadpt2, invadpt2, 0, ROT270, "Sanritsu",       "Space War (Sanritsu)" )
 * In MAME 0.37b2 the roms sanritsu.3 and sanritsu.4 were replaced with rom ic35.bin from spacewr3. I splitted ic35.bin and
    checksums for sanritsu.3 + sanritsu.4 = ic35.bin are correct!
 * ROM_START( spcewars ) ROM_REGION( 0x10000, REGION_CPU1 )     /* 64k for code */ ROM_LOAD( "sanritsu.1",   0x0000, 0x0400,
    0xca331679 ) ROM_LOAD( "sanritsu.2",   0x0400, 0x0400, 0x48dc791c ) ROM_LOAD( "ic35.bin",     0x0800, 0x0800, 0x40c2d55b )
 * ROM_LOAD( "sanritsu.5",   0x1000, 0x0400, 0x77475431 ) ROM_LOAD( "sanritsu.6",   0x1400, 0x0400, 0x392ef82c ) ROM_LOAD(
    "sanritsu.7",   0x1800, 0x0400, 0xb3a93df8 ) ROM_LOAD( "sanritsu.8",   0x1c00, 0x0400, 0x64fdc3e1 ) ROM_LOAD( "sanritsu.9",
    0x4000, 0x0400, 0xb2f29601 ) ROM_END
 * I reverted this roms change from 0.37b2 back to MAME 0.36b16 to clarify that spcewars is not a mixty-maxty of different romset.
