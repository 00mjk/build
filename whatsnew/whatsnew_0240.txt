8343: Fixed j6bigbuk Exchange Number button port name and in layout [TheBoyCanFly]

8407: Change Hyperdrive's upper serial number offset. [Hydreigon223]
This now makes the game read its PIC as the correct ID instead of a development PIC. Verified this from a vague picture of a spare
  Hyperdrive pic showing the game ID.
Other changes:
- Remove player 3 and 4 inputs for games that don't use them

8863: Adding bitmap_printer_device and session_time device and converting epson_lx810 to use it. [goldnchild]
Hi guys,
I wanted you to have a look at this to see if I'm on the right track.
Some background on my bitmap_printer_device:
I noticed that all of the dot matrix printers have very similar needs, a cr_stepper, pf_stepper and a page bitmap to draw on, so why
  not have a "bitmap_printer_device" that will take care of that so you don't have to duplicate a lot of code. I was thinking that
  "bitmap_printer_device" could be renamed "dot_printer_device" possibly.
It watches when you move the pf stepper and if you pass the bottom margin, saves out a page as a png and moves to a fresh page.
The steppers use the "standard" pattern from the steppers.c file, just doing a bitswap to make the patterns fit that standard
  sequence. Reversing the bits has the effect of reversing the direction of movement.
The printhead is a little bit more complicated, so it's left to the driver to do that.
The purpose of the session_time device is just to give a unique filename based on the current time the session started, with the
  ability to reset the session_time and page number if you were going to start a printout and wanted it to start at page 1.
So for example, it will save filenames like the following in the "imagewriter" directory:
imagewriter_2021-09-17_22-12-12_ct486-board2-comat-serport1_page_006.png
imagewriter_2021-09-18_00-17-21_a500-rs232_page_001.png
imagewriter_2021-09-18_19-07-59_coco2-rs232_page_001.png
imagewriter_2021-09-20_06-00-15_c64-user-rs232-rs232_page_001.png
imagewriter_2021-09-30_20-34-11_bbcb-rs423_page_001.png
imagewriter_2021-10-05_04-24-25_apple2p-sl1-ssc-rs232_page_001.png
imagewriter_2021-11-21_09-18-39_mac512k-rs232a_page_001.png
And since the session time and the tag is unique, you can have multiple printers on a system and they will save as different
  filenames.
for the silentype printer:
silentype_printer_2021-11-19_04-51-25_apple2p-sl1-silentype_page_001.png
for the ap2000 printer:
ap2000_2021-11-21_08-50-32_apple2p-sl1-uniprint-prn_page_001.png
I've converted the lx810l to use the bitmap_printer_device, which wasn't too difficult.  Since the screen/page display and the
  steppers are part of the bitmap_printer_device, there's less code in the epson_lx810l.cpp/h files.
Future enhancements could be to track the speed of the steppers to have more precise position than just whole steps.
I was also interested in making it so that the bitmap would be larger than just a single page (like 2 pages) to accommodate printing
  on the page boundary. But for now, we'll just have a single page to work with.

8961: New scaling algorithm. Fixes aspect related issues, undesired overscan, etc. [antonioginer]
Solves issues related to: https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/8209
Fixes: https://github.com/mamedev/mame/issues/8387
Fixes: https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=8110
This is a general case algorithm for all scale modes. Now, the SCALE_FRACTIONAL case wouldn't need a separate implementation
  anymore, however I'd rather keep it by now since it's much simpler than the general case.
I would have preferred a "single run" algorithm like the previous ones, but the way these features are expected to work seems to
  require a "find-best-fit" type of implementation, that correctly accounts for the effects of rounding scale values to integers
  over respective axes.

9050: gaelco.cpp: Redumped 'biomtoyc' [Tailsnic Retroworks] [clawgrip]
The gfx and sound ROMs on 'biomtoyc' were (incorrectly) added from another set.
Also fixed the manufacturer name on Zeus games, added the checksum on the game names (very useful when searching for Gaelco clones)
  and reformatted comments.
Finally, found and dumped a Squash on a 922804/2 PCB, resulting the same as the 'squash' set, and a Thunder Hoop on a 922804/2 PCB
  with different ROMs layout, (half-capacity EPROMs), but also with the same contents as the existing set. Added notes about both
  cases.

9051: h8_sci_device: don't set TDRE when receiving [devinacker]
This seems to fix an issue with ctk551 where transmitting and receiving MIDI at the same time could cause TX interrupts to not occur
  properly, which could cause the firmware's outgoing MIDI buffer to become full, at which point it locks up waiting for the buffer
  to be processed by an interrupt that never occurs.
The new behavior was verified against the H8/3397 manual from Renesas.

9111: ksys573: Guitar Freaks knob and wail input fixes [987123879113]
- The effect inputs are supposed to be one knob per player, not separate buttons. With this change it's possible to change the knob
  values `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> ...` in the IO test menu.
- Wail inputs were broken in some of the few Guitar Freaks games that make use of the memory card reader's PS1 controller ports
  because when the games detect a PS1 controller then it would override the wail inputs from the arcade controller. This change
  makes it so that the games doesn't think controllers are connected when nothing is selected as a controller in the slots menu.

9112: k573dio: Document new registers and update PCB schematic [987123879113]
- Network communication registers have been documented. I don't know the proper way to implement RS485 to connect multiple instances
  of MAME together so the registers are stubbed for now. See https://github.com/mamedev/mame/issues/9090 and
  https://github.com/mamedev/mame/issues/9101 for discussion.
- MP3 start/end addresses are read in some cases so I've added the appropriate readers.

I think this is correct.  LDAX instructions from  29-2f   and STAX instructions from 39-3f are listed as 2 byte instructions but
  they're only 1 byte.
Since they're one byte too large, it causes a skipped instruction to skip 1 more byte than it should.
There's another table for the 7807 with the exact same entries but I don't have a datasheet so I'll leave that to someone who knows
  more than me.

9138: dietgo.cpp: new working clone [sergiopolog]
Credits: Sergio Galiano, Recreativos Piscis
New parent set for dietgo found in a board in which program roms has these labels:

* jy_01-3.5h
PCB pictures:
<https://i.imgur.com/QKR97tW.jpg>
<https://i.imgur.com/loVTslu.jpg>
While program roms in current parent set has the "version" digit as "2" (i.e.: jy_00-2.4h), this one is "version" 3, so it's assumed
  newer.
Both dietgo and dietgoe has same version 1.1 and same date 1992.09.26 now, so I put a v3 and v2 in their titles:
* ``dietgo``: Diet Go Go (Euro v1.1 1992.09.26 v3)
* ``dietgoe``: Diet Go Go (Euro v1.1 1992.09.26 v2)
For current Euro sets of the game I performed these changes in set names:
* old ``dietgo`` is now: ``dietgoe``
* old ``dietgoe`` is now: ``dietgoea``
are new titles and set names correct?

9139: Removed protection hack and replaced with logic from PAL dump. [va7deo]
The protection workaround was replaced with emulation of the PAL16R6.  The logic equations were based on the PAL dump and output of

9154: ksys573: Implement motor movement for Punch Mania/Fighting Mania I/O and add layout [987123879113]
Previously Punch Mania/Fighting Mania would be pretty much on auto play and you would have to actively press the button to make it
  miss a punch. I believe the game is checking motor speed during calibration on boot and going from 0 to 255 instantly when a motor
  was triggered caused issues with its calibrations. Adding time-based movement to the motors instead of going from 0 to 255
  instantly fixed the issue with inputs in-game and now it requires you to hit the button/pad as expected.
I also created a layout to make these games playable as intended. The punch pads will fade in and out depending on how far the pad
  is supposed to be extended. There is an LED on each pad that will light up at the correct timing for when you are supposed to
  actually punch, and if you punch when the LED is off then it's only counted as a "BAD" or "OK" instead of "GOOD" punch. I emulated
  this by drawing a red layer over the pad block in the layout.

Here's a video of the layout in action on the test I/O menu:

And here's a video of the layout during gameplay:

> ~STB (Strobe Input).  A "low" on this input loads data into the input latch.

9165: New working clone [algestam]
----------
Game & Watch: Game & Watch: Mario's Cement Factory (Table Top, version CM-72A) [algestam, Alexander Bliven]
This PR adds support for the alternate variant of the table top version of G&W Mario's Cement Factory. The difference between this
  variant and the other is that this version plays another startup jingle.
I'm not sure on how to name this driver correctly to follow the MAME naming standards. The name for the driver has been set to be
  `gnw_mariocmta` where the `a` in the suffix is meant to indicate that it is for the alternate variant of the game. Please advice
  if the name should be changed to something else.
The program ROM has been verified to be identical between the different variants, only the melody ROM differs. The model numbers are
  the same on both units, the only difference is the MCU chip label (`CM-72` and `CM-72A`).
The melody ROM data has been extracted using the same technique as for other non-decapped SM511/SM512 MCU:s where the melody ROM is
  reconstructed from data collected and analyzed while making the MCU play back sounds from the melody ROM. Only the startup jingle
  has been changed between the CM-72 and CM-72A versions. The startup jingle is located at note 52 to 76 in the melody ROM (which
  holds 256 notes).

9166: nes/bus: Small fixes for Sunsoft FME-7 IRQ. [0kmg]
- Removed hard-coded NTSC timing. Improves raster-split effects for the two PAL games, Mr. Gimmick and Batman Return of the Joker.

9167: nes_apu.cpp: Added missing DPCM period table for PAL. (MT8183) [0kmg]
Fixes pitch being flat for DPCM sounds for nespal (and m82p). This is most apparent in Mr. Gimmick, though it affects all software
  that use the DPCM channel.

  Arcade.

The Fast and the Furious original arcade game was released in 2004, not 2014.

9174: yuvomz80.cpp: Correct machine name [negunma]
From YouTube video references and ROM analyzing, ymz ICs of conventional goldhexa set have sounds of Hexa President and doesn't have
  songs of Golden Hexa.
goldhexa set should be renamed as "Hexa President (YMZ280B set)".
Release month of Hexa President is described as early June of 1995 in Game Machine no.499
  (https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19950715p.pdf) P.19.
(Golden Hexa is posted its advertise in Game Machine no.457 (https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19930915p.pdf) p.11, published in
  1993.)

9175: segag80v.cpp: Corrected speech ROM labels for zektor and startrek [tacotown]
I recently ran mame and saw I could no longer run zektor due to this commit:
Fix a typo in a ROM filename (1607->1670) commit d26b99931c00c2ec5d097bfc82d443dad4d44469
The 1607 was not a typo; I was there 25 years ago when the ROMS for Zektor were
originally read from the speech PCB.
In addition, I noticed that startrek had, all this time, also been using the incorrect
ROM labeling.  A quick online search of "star trek speech pcb" will bring up a visual of the original
PCB with the EPROM clearly labeled "1607". 
Besides, EPROM number 1670 is reserved for Tac/Scan; Sega/Gremlin didn't reuse EPROM numbers, though they
did reuse the eproms themselves across games (for example, Space Fury and Astro Blaster also share speech EPROM 808).
Unfortunately, this will effect people playing zektor and startrek. Perhaps mame needs either a more
stringent review for EPROM labeling changes or a fuzzy match/renaming based on matching crc so changes like
this will be less impactful

-device_image_interface: Interface overhaul [AJR]
 * Remove the iodevice_t classification, which was not used that much and was incomplete anyway. Image device implementations must
    now provide their own instance names and brief instance names. Several new parent classes have been created to make it easier to
    use the old standard names.
 * Change must_be_loaded from a pure virtual function to be overridden in implementations to a getter for a base class property that
    can be set on the host side (as was formerly made possible for NES, MD and "generic" cartridge slots) but defaults to false for
    all types. This restrictive property has been unset for a small number of cases.
 * Create parent classes for paper tape and magnetic tape devices. At present these are dummy classes that do little to nothing, but
    may help unify implementations in the future.
 * Change several member functions to take std::string_view parameters rather than const std::string & or const char *.
 * Make update_names take into account brief names, as discussed in PR #2555.
 * Remove the obsolete uses_file_extension function (which used thread-unsafe strtok).
