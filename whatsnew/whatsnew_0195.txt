-x1: convert I/O to memory maps and bankdev [Vas Crabb]

-revert "Popeye (bootleg set 1)" to 0.33b6 names and contents. The tile ROM was replaced with the contents from the TPP2 set and all
 the graphics roms were renamed to match the names in use at the time. The tile rom in the recently dumped "Popeye (bootleg set 2)"
 also matches the old tile rom, so it's a reasonable bet that the dump was correct. [smf]

-electron: Added cartridge devices for: [Nigel Barnes]
 * P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 3/4
 * Advanced Quarter Meg Ram
 * Cumana Floppy Disk System
 * Sound Expansion

-API change: Memory maps are now "last entry wins" [O. Galibert]
 * This allows for the much more natural "import another map and patch it" structure, or "cover a whole region then punch holes in
    it".  Our previous first-entry-wins rule was always a surprise to newcomers, and oldcomers too.

-ponpoko: Use 4-way joystick [AJR]

-new clone added - Target Ball '96 [briantro]

 bit isn't hooked up on the schematics and the game doesn't access it, so I've changed it to unused. [smf]

-Sky Skipper: Added difficulty DIP switches [smf]

-namcona1.cpp: fix soft reset hangs [Angelo Salese]

-namcona1.cpp: improved encapsulation [Angelo Salese]

-Workable Stepping Stage driver, and recently dumped VJDash [Naibo]
 * Workable stepstag driver:
 * Added fundamental communication between main 68000 and (undumped) Windows PC
 * Figured out correct logic of data uploading from main CPU to (maybe an FPGA on some unknown board)
 * Discovered proper V-blank frequency of 4 logigal screens(routed to 3 physical screens in real hardware), which effects the
    communication and synchronization between 2 68000 CPUs, thus affect booting
 * Borrowed foreground graphics from vjdash, added proper foreground layer handling, and removed hack code
 * Seperated palette and decoding of 3 screens, and added independent 3rd screen decoding/drawing routine, as each screen has their
    own palette, and may display totally non-related graphics
 * Corrected sprite rom loading of step3
 * Mapped dancing floor light, spot light, neon light, and key led output, based on some video footage of real arcade machines
 * Corrected NVRAM handling
 * Adjusted key-mapping of foot step input port, avoided key conflict
 * The in-game palettes are in 8-BIT YUV(UYUY) format. Each entry may contains 2 pixels. In the real game hardware, the sprites are
    to be mixed with a MPEG-1 under-layer, then converted together to RGB
 * Driver for the recently dumped Vjdash (a 4-monitor game):
 * Figured out that vjdash uses similar hardware to Stepping Stage
 * Identified graphics roms of fg/bg/rotation layers
 * Been able to boot to self-test, thus mapped inputs
 * In addition to the currently obtained board, this game also needs a 2nd 68000 board which drives 3 upper screens, and one Windows
    PC, like in Stepping Stage series.
 * This board may have 2 more (missing?) ROM ICs, for sprites

-namcona1.cpp: fixed status bar colors for VS Express event in Numan Athletics [Angelo Salese]

-namcona1.cpp: fixed video disable graphic transitions (i.e. temporary gfx seizures) [Angelo Salese]

-namcona1.cpp: Added dynamic screen visible area change effect, used mostly by Numan Athletics on transitions [Angelo Salese]

-create derived 6502 type for XaviX because it has at least one custom… (#3154) [David Haywood]
 * create derived 6502 type for XaviX because it has at least one custom 4-byte opcode that doesn't fit any other type. treating
    that opcode as NOP for now.
 * have a feeling it might be something to do with the other integrated hardware, might be 'execute co-processor code chain at this
    address' or something similar It isn't a standard JSL (Jump Subroutine Long)  like the SNES cpu opcode in the same place as
    this, it seems to point at some code-like structures tho) could also be a secondary operation mode with different encoding like
    ARM's Thumb mode tho I guess.
 * We currently only have a single XaviX based dump (taitons1) but there are more on the way.  I'm going to see if the code flow
    makes any sense at all with these missing, or if any of it gives a clue as to what they should actually do.
 * xavix - let's call these callf and retf then
 * after further investigation these are some kind of extra 'long jump' subroutine / task handlers, the 0x80 also being a custom
    opcode was throwing me off trying to identify them before.
 * looks like they might have been hacking 65816 features into the regular 6502 core?

-new NOT WORKING (various drivers) (#3161) [David Haywood]
 * new NOT WORKING Zone 40 [BeckyRGB] Wireless Air 60 [BeckyRGB]
 * it isn't 100% clear these belong here, but it's also possible they do, so until more is known, put them here.

 * new machines marked as NOT WORKING - Play TV Ping Pong [Sean Riddle]

 latest changes, and promoted everything that works better now. [rzero9]
 * Also, I have added several new dumps to the softlists. Some are mine and some aren't, so here are the details:
 * Dumped by "known" people:
 * Battle Chess [redump.org / r09]
 * Cameltry [r09]
 * Dragon Slayer - The Legend of Heroes [r09]
 * Emit Vol. 1 - Toki no Maigo [redump.org / r09]
 * Emit Vol. 2 - Inochigake no Tabi [redump.org / r09]
 * Ku²++ [Tokugawa Corporate Forums / DamienD]
 * Unknown source (obtained from Japanese anonymous P2P services):
 * Doda Mega-Mix!!!
 * Oshare Club
 * Rinkan Gakkou
 * Sakura no Mori
 * (the last two are the same in the PC-9801 CD list; they are hybrid discs)
 * The Cameltry and LoH disks are protected, so the dumps were created with a Kryoflux and converted to the HxC MFM format. LoH
    works fine, but Cameltry doesn't. Could be related to the copy protection or not.

-at.cpp: Added Compaq Portable II [rfka01]

-some fixes and some new translation additions(180208) [kadireksi]

-Several nes_vt Fixes and Improvements [daveshah1]
 * Add support for a newer VTxx chipset with scrambled instructions and RGB444 palette, used in the FC Pocket and DGUN-2573. This
    includes adding a new CPU type for this, which is a 6502 with a "scrambled" mode where the opcodes are XORed with 0xA1.
 * Add the following new systems (dumped by myself unless credit specified):
   - SY-888B (similar to SY-889)
   - 89 in 1 Mini Game Console [TeamEurope]
   - CoolBoy RS-18 280 in 1 [TeamEurope]
   - Pocket Games 150 in 1 [taken from NES software list]
   - Handheld 210 in 1 [taken from NES software list]
   - DV-Tech Nimbus [cah3e3]

   - FC Pocket 600 in 1
   - MOGIS M320
   - Family Pocket 638 in 1
   - Hummer Z-Dog [unknown]
 * Add support for scrambled banking, so the Sports Game 69 in 1, Samuri 60 in 1, Z-Dog, and Power Joy now work correctly.
 * General Improvements/Fixes including:
   - Improve PPU colour palette (credit to NewRisingSun for reference code).
   - Fix scanline IRQs, stops Super Mario Bros 3 and Z-Dog from crashing
   - Fix PPU data reads, fixes Super Mario Bros title screen and a few other games

-Add more DC games to softlist Is now just in the beginning of D. [FakeShemp]
 * Removes all the CDI/NRG conversions and replaces them with comments.

-clone added Pac-Land (Bally-Midway) hi, i found a pacland pcb, it's almost a "pacland" set but with two different eprom contents in
 the cpu program area, one eprom and one maskrom, so it should be a genuine romset. i will send dumps and pcb picture to dev if
 needed, if you need more info let me know. regards. [fraido]
 * andrea palazzetti

-Workable Stepping Stage driver, and recently dumped VJDash [Naibo] Workable stepstag driver: [cuavas]
 * Added fundamental communication between main 68000 and (undumped) Windows PC
 * Figured out correct logic of data uploading from main CPU to (maybe an FPGA on some unknown board)
 * Discovered proper V-blank frequency of 4 logigal screens(routed to 3 physical screens in real hardware), which effects the
    communication and synchronization between 2 68000 CPUs, thus affect booting
 * Borrowed foreground graphics from vjdash, added proper foreground layer handling, and removed hack code
 * Seperated palette and decoding of 3 screens, and added independent 3rd screen decoding/drawing routine, as each screen has their
    own palette, and may display totally non-related graphics
 * Corrected sprite rom loading of step3
 * Mapped dancing floor light, spot light, neon light, and key led output, based on some video footage of real arcade machines
 * Corrected NVRAM handling
 * Adjusted key-mapping of foot step input port, avoided key conflict
 * The in-game palettes are in 8-BIT YUV(UYUY) format. Each entry may contains 2 pixels. In the real game hardware, the sprites are
    to be mixed with a MPEG-1 under-layer, then converted together to RGB
 * Driver for the recently dumped Vjdash (a 4-monitor game):
 * Figured out that vjdash uses similar hardware to Stepping Stage
 * Identified graphics roms of fg/bg/rotation layers
 * Been able to boot to self-test, thus mapped inputs
 * In addition to the currently obtained board, this game also needs a 2nd 68000 board which drives 3 upper screens, and one Windows
    PC, like in Stepping Stage series.
 * This board may have 2 more (missing?) ROM ICs, for sprites

-toratora.cpp dsw fixes & locations added Noticed that these were wrong, fixed them according to the manual & added switch
 locations. [Bad-A-Billy]

 the screen shows garbage although the correct video chip is hooked up. [rfka01]

-create derived 6502 type for XaviX because it has at least one custom 4-byte opcode that doesn't fit any other type. [DavidHaywood]
 * treating that opcode as NOP for now.
 * actually 2 opcodes, that appear to be far call and far return (at least)

-The start of a Dreamcast softlist This was basically started as a documentation effort, so a lot of the games lack an actual dump
 and are simply there in the form of informational comments. [FakeShemp]
 * Currently only lists # through to A and their clones if any.
 * Not hooked up to the dc driver as I have no idea how. Will do so if I can get a pointer in the right direction.

this one does a jump to a vector in ram in the interrupt routine, telling me that my irq enable is wrong.  so far every single XaviX
  dump has provided a little bit extra useful information :-) [DavidHaywood]
Hammer Boy [alt/deepfb, Dan Dare, mad3001, Habi, Adonías, cpcmaniaco, Robcfg, Pablo Ruiz, Recreativas.org, The Dumping Union]
can't coin up / dips seem to have no effect, might be unhappy with the PIC response from the Megaphoenix Pic, might be possible to
  kludge it if that is the case. [DavidHaywood]
The code on this one is much closer to Taito Nostalgia, seemingly only using the callfar / returnfar extended opcodes, this further
  makes me think that XaviX Tennis is a Super XaviX title instead. [DavidHaywood]
