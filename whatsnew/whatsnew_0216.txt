-eispc_twib: backed out of bitbanger approach for now [Joakim Larsson Edstrom]

-Make devdelegate more like devcb for configuration.  This is a fundamental change to show device delegates are configured.
 [Vas Crabb]
 * Device delegates are now aware of the current device during configuration and will resolve string tags relative to it.  This
    means that device delegates need a device to be supplied on construction so they can find the machine configuration object.
    There's a one-dimensional array helper to make it easier to construct arrays of device delegates with the same owner.  (I didn't
    make an n-dimensional one because I didn't hit a use case, but it would be a simple addition.)
 * There's no more bind_relative_to member - just call resolve() like you would for a devcb.  There's also no need to cast nullptr
    when creating a late bind device delegate.  The flip side is that for an overloaded or non-capturing lambda you'll need to cast
    to the desired type.
 * There is one less conditional branch in the hot path for calls for delegates bound to a function pointer of member function
    pointer.  This comes at the cost of one additional unconditional branch in the hot path for calls to delegates bound to
    functoids (lambdas, functions that don't take an object reference, other callable objects).  This applies to all delegates, not
    just device delegates.
 * Address spaces will now print an error message if a late bind error is encountered while installing a handler.  This will give
    the range and address range, hopefully making it easier to guess which memory map is faulty.
 * For the simple case of allowing a device_delegate member to be configured, use a member like this:
 * template <typename... T> void set_foo(T &&...args) { m_foo_cb.set(std::forward<T>(args)...); }
 * For a case where different delegates need to be used depending on the function signature, see src/emu/screen.h (the screen update
    function setters).
 * Device delegates now take a target specification and function pointer. The target may be:
 * Target omitted, implying the current device being configured.  This can only be used during configuration.  It will work as long
    as the current device is not removed/replaced.
 * A tag string relative to the current device being configured.  This can only be used during configuration.  It will not be
    callable until .resolve() is called.  It will work as long as the current device is not removed/replaced.
 * A device finder (required_device/optional_device).  The delegate will late bind to the current target of the device finder.  It
    will not be callable until .resolve() is called.  It will work properly if the target device is replaced, as long as the device
    finder's base object isn't removed/replaced.
 * A reference to an object.  It will be callable immediately.  It will work as long as the target object is not removed/replaced.
 * The target types and restrictions are pretty similar to what you already have on object finders and devcb, so it shouldn't cause
    any surprises. Note that dereferencing a device finder will changes the effect.  To illustrate this:
 * ... required_device<some_device> m_dev; ... m_dev(*this, "dev") ... // will late bind to "dev" relative to *this // will work if
    "dev" hasn't been created yet or is replaced later // won't work if *this is removed/replaced // won't be callable until
    resolve() is called cb1.set(m_dev, FUNC(some_device::w)); ... // will bind to current target of m_dev // will not work if m_dev
    is not resolved // will not work if "dev" is replaced later // will be callable immediately cb2.set(*m_dev,
    FUNC(some_device::w)); ...
 * The order of the target and name has been reversed for functoids (lambdas and other callable objects).  This allows the NAME
    macro to be used on lambdas and functoids.  For example:
 * foo.set_something(NAME([this] (u8 data) { m_something = data; }));
 * I realise the diagnostic messages get ugly if you use NAME on a large lambda.  You can still give a literal name, you just have
    to place it after the lambda rather than before.  This is uglier, but it's intentional.  I'm trying to drive developers away
    from a certain style. While it's nice that you can put half the driver code in the memory map, it detracts from readability.
    It's hard to visualise the memory range mappings if the memory map functions are punctuated by large lambdas. There's also
    slightly higher overhead for calling a delegate bound to a functoid.
 * If the code is prettier for trivial lambdas but uglier for non-trivial lambdas in address maps, it will hopefully steer people
    away from putting non-trivial lambdas in memory maps.
 * There were some devices that were converted from using plain delegates without adding bind_relative_to calls.  I fixed some of
    them (e.g. LaserDisc) but I probably missed some.  These will likely crash on unresolved delegate calls.
 * There are some devices that reset delegates at configuration complete or start time, preventing them from being set up during
    configuration (e.g. src/devices/video/ppu2c0x.cpp and src/devices/machine/68307.cpp).  This goes against the design principles
    of how device delegates should be used, but I didn't change them because I don't trust myself to find all the places they're
    used.
 * I've definitely broken some stuff with this (I know about asterix), so report issues and bear with me until I get it all fixed.

-tilemap.cpp: Relax assert and do some sanity checks (fixes mtrain and strain with DEBUG=1) [AJR]
 * Note that opengolf is still broken, with a segmentation fault occurring at some point.

-hvyunit: Fix coin counters [AJR]

-Fix waitvsync for bgfx vulkan backend. [Couriersud]
 * Currently waitvsync is broken in the bgfx vulkan backend. The option is just ignored and a mode waiting for vsync is selected.
    This also breaks throttle. -nothrottle doesn't work.
 * These changes fix this. If available a non-syncing mode is used if
 * nowaitvsync is used.

-add some c-board pal dumps [TwistedTom]

-New working clone [braintro]

-MT 07469: vboy: sprite elements are cut off. [Robbbert]

-netlist: Preprocessor enhancements. [Couriersud]
 * The builtin preprocessor now behaves closer to cpp:
 * supports macro parameters, i.e. define x(a) a
 * supports stringification, i.e. define x(a) #a
 * supports concatenation, i.e. define x(a) a ## _ext
 * In addition, error reporting now provides a source context including the include history.

-Start work on C64 tapes (#5803) [Zoë Blade]
 * Hit Squad ➡️ The Hit Squad
 * This is a brand/label of Ocean.  See any of their packaging to verify it's "The Hit Squad".
 * Tentatively add more C64 tape dumps
 * Add some more UK C64 tapes
 * It's a start...
 * Hewson (Rack IT) ➡️ Rack It
 * It looks like the publisher should take the form "Label" rather than "Company (Label)", judging by "The Hit Squad" (Ocean),
    "Mastertronic Added Dimension" (Mastertronic), etc., so let's be consistent about that.
 * Also, it's "Rack It", not "Rack IT".  See e.g. the scan-in at
    https://archive.org/25/items/uta_Steel_1988_Hewson_Rack_IT_7197/uta_Steel_1988_Hewson_Rack_IT_7197_screenshot.jpg which shows
    the label name for both the copyright and address.
 * Use labels consistently
 * Gremlin Graphics (GBH) ➡️ GBH Grandslam (Bug Byte) ➡️ Bug Byte CDS Software (Blue Ribbon) ➡️ Blue Ribbon
 * Add tape

-i8251a initilization changed (#5825) [Joakim Larsson Edström]
 * i8251.cpp: required initial state to enable receiver of a 8251a and also to avoid sending start bit to diserial on reset and get
    framing error
 * eispc_kb.cpp: removed need for scheduler abuse as problem is fixed by correcting the init of the i8251 USART on host side instead
 * eispc.cpp: removed an obsolete TODO

-es5506.cpp : Fix regression [cam900]

-megaplay.cpp : Fix SMS VDP overlay [cam900]

-swtpc8212: get it running, and on the rs232 bus (#5729) [68bit]
 * This patch gets it running, and splits it into two front ends, one being a rs232 bus slot so that is can be used as a terminal
    option. It adds the MCM66750 character generator, and implements the MC6845 row update function. Most of the I/O has been worked
    out with help from the CT-82 user manual. The various screen formats and the graphics modes appear to be working and plausible.
    Printer support has been added, and a beeper.

-cinemat.cpp: corrected ROM labels for solarq [Andrew Welburn]

-scc68070: Add more accurate cycle counts, distinguished from MC68000 and MC68010 [AJR]

-EPC: Keyboard working, added leds and removed imperfect feature (#5832) [Joakim Larsson Edström]

    framing error
 * eispc_kb.cpp: removed need for scheduler abuse as problem is fixed by correcting the init of the i8251 USART on host side instead
 * eispc.cpp: removed an obsolete TODO
 * eispc_kb.h: removed imperfect_features marking
 * epc: Added keyboard LEDs, Caps and Num lock works with current keyboard rom, scroll lock led needs a dump from a newer keyboard

-Added two new unreleased Model Racing games (#5813) [janniz]
 * Fixed LOG_WAV_ENABLED_ONLY (m_enable has to be checked only if LOG_WAV_ENABLED_ONLY is set) Added log data to the right channel
    of the wave, accordingly to the definition declared in LOG_WAV_VALUE_R
 * Fixed an error with tag() returning a ':' and generating a filename not valid in Windows environment
 * Added Model Racing "Cane"
 * Added Model Racing "Orbite"
 * Replaced the char array with a std::string in sn76477_device::open_wav_file to override possible buffer overrun. Minor cosmetic
    change in a boolean expression in sn76477_device::sound_stream_update
 * Refactored "Cane" related code creating an audio device to encapsulate the audio system Refactored "Cane" and "Orbite" creating
    their own classes Other minor changes in indentation of the source code

-Spring cleaning: [Vas Crabb]
 * Changed emu_fatalerror to use util::string_format semantics
 * Fixed some incorrectly marked up stuff in build scripts
 * Make internal layout compression type a scoped enum (only zlib is supported still, but at least the values aren't magic numbers
    now)
 * Fixed memory leaks in Xbox USB
 * There can only be one "perfect quantum" device - enforce that only the root machine can set it, as allowing subdevices to will
    cause weird issues with slot cards overiding it
 * Allow multiple devices to set maximum quantum and use the most restrictive one (it's maximum quantum, it would be minimum
    interleave)
 * Got rid of device_slot_card_interface as it wasn't providing value
 * Added a helper template to reduce certain kinds of boilerplate in slots/buses
 * Cleaned up some particularly bad slot code (plenty more of that to do), and made some slots more idiomatic

-netlist: Compile with float/double floating point. [Couriersud]
 * Added ability to compile using float instead of double. Specifically the the solver as well as the infrastructure now can have
    their own floating point type. Currently this is only an academic exercise since numerically demanding circuits like kidniki
    only work with double/double support. Using float here is pushing numerical stability over the limits.
 * The long term design goal is too have the matrix type (double/float) being a parameter.

-es5506.cpp : Correct algorithms, Allow signed shifting (#5837) [cam900]
 * es5506.cpp : Correct algorithms, Allow signed shifting
 * es5506.cpp : Fix envelope

-es5506.cpp : Fix volume, Reduce unnecessary values [cam900]

-new NOT WORKING machines (Air-Blaster Joystick) (#5841) [David Haywood]
 * new NOT WORKING machines
   - -- Air-Blaster Joystick (AB1500, PAL) [David Haywood,  Morten Kirkegaard, Peter Wilhelmsen]
 * boots, 2d games can be played, although speed probably not correct.  3d sections don't work properly at all.  dump is pending 2nd
    verification, but I think the issues are emulation issues (missing timers etc.)

-rocnrope.cpp (ropeman):  Added pal10l8.6g  [Joe Magiera]

-netlist: Support for float, double and long double solvers. [Couriersud]
 * Added new solver parameter FPTYPE. This determines in which floating point domain the linear system is solved. May be one of
    "FLOAT", "DOUBLE" or "LONGDOUBLE"
 * Added option "--fperr" to nltool. This enables floating point exceptions. This helps debugging the code under gdb.
 * The purpose of this going forward is to have more choice in optimization. Non-dynamic systems should be just fine in the float
    domain. Dynamic systems (i.e. diodes, bjts, mosfets) should in general work with double. Certain edge cases may require long
    double resolution.

-netlist: add RELTOL/VNTOL solver parameters. Type safety. [Couriersud]
 * The newly added RELTOL and VNTOL parameters implement Newton convergence checks comparable following other SPICE implementations.
    The ACCURACY solver parameter now is only used for convergence checks in iterative solvers.
 * In addition, type safety was significantly improved and a lot of "magic" numbers are identifiable now.

 * snes_ppu: Fixed rapid vertical scrolling in rexronan and other games. [Ryan Holtz]

-MAMETesters Bugs Fixed [mooglyguy]

-galaga: Implement accurate starfield based on reverse eng. 05xx (#5824) [Robert Hildinger]
 * galaga: Implement accurate starfield based on reverse eng. 05xx
   - --------------------------------------------------------------- This commit implements an accurate starfield for Galaga and
      Bosconian based on reverse engineering the Namco 05xx chip. Documentation and notes have been added inline to the code for the
      galaga video driver.
 * Changes in this commit:
 * 1. Regenerates starfield colors based on LFSR state for every frame 2. Pixel accurate to Namco original 05xx 3. Restores one line
    horizontal starfield shift for every 256 vertical pixel shifts 4. Properly handles LFSR reset (_STARCLR) 5. Restores missing 4
    stars from previous implementations 6. Fixes potential issue with the number of stars on screen at any one time 7. Restores 4
    pixel/line scrolling capability (not currently used for any driver)
 * galaga: inplement accurate starfield - change request 1
   - ------------------------------------------------------ 1. Remove stdlib.h from src/mame/video/galaga.cpp
 * galaga: inplement accurate starfield - change request 2
   - ------------------------------------------------------ 1. Refactor starfield generator into stand-alone video device 2.
      Simplify Bosconian and Galaga video drivers 3. Add in documentation about different LFSR form used by Wolfgang Scherr and
      Jindřich Makovička.

   - -------------------------------------------------------- Minor changes from pull request review

-Avoid some redundant PORT_CHANGED_MEMBER uses. [68bit]

-netlist: Completed __float128 support. [Couriersud]
 * Both compiling the core and the shaders with __float128 now work. The support was added to be ready to deal with academic edge
    cases.
 * Performance drops to 10% of double - thus disabled by default.

-Preliminary SoC emulation for Sitronix ST2204 and ST2205U [AJR]

-New working software list additions [ArcadeShadow]
 * ibm5170: The Settlers, Syndicate

-Galaga: small fix and some notes. [Couriersud]
 * leave some more information about the equivalent galois LFSR like taps and seed values.
 * All members are now initialized by constructor.

-pongf, rebound: Performance increases. [Couriersud]
 * Switched nl_pongf to dynamic timestepping. Pongf now runs about 20% faster than previously. About the same for rebound.

-Fix invalid std::vector<> lookup in aviio.cpp [npwoods]
 * This fixes a case where:
 * m_soundbuf_samples == processedsamples
 * processedsamples > 0
 * processedsamples * stream->channels() == m_soundbuf.size()
 * In this scenario, the std::memmove() would do nothing (moving zero bytes), but the operator[] on the second parameter to
    std::memmove() overflows the array.  This can be benign in optimized builds (because the third parameter to std::memmove() is
    0), but on debugging builds this can cause an assert.

-epos.cpp: Redumped color BPROM for Eeekk! correcting colors. [Andrew Welburn]

-Plug & Play / Elan EU3A05 / EU3A14 splitting up, identifying of common features etc. (#5849) [David Haywood]

-bgfx: fix tgmj crash on resolution change (GitHub #5857) [Ryan Holtz [Vas Crabb]

-prototypes from third session of Sonic Month 2019 (#5851) [kazblox]
 * New prototypes:
 * gamegear: Sonic the Hedgehog Chaos (Euro, Prototype 19930517) [Hidden Palace] sms: Sonic the Hedgehog Chaos (Euro, "Ver 0.20",
    Prototype 19930630) [Hidden Palace] Sonic the Hedgehog Chaos (Euro, Prototype 19930713) [Hidden Palace]
 * These prototypes are believed to have been solely burned for Sega Europe/UK, and thus are all labeled "Euro".
 * Mark sms/sonicc630 as not working, as it somehow crashes after the title screen.
 * renamed sonicc in gamegear.xml from "Sonic Chaos" to "Sonic the Hedgehog Chaos" to maintain consistency (box art for Game Gear
    release packaging says "Sonic the Hedgehog Chaos" too) as well, while correcting a capitalization error for actionfg0.

 * snes_ppu: Ported over more of bsnes's ppu-fast implementation. Fixes many bugs, possibly causes more. [byuu, Ryan Holtz]

 * screen: Only clear or allocate scan bitmaps in excess of the previous height. Fixes blank portions of smw2u, possibly others.

 * redumped gameking mc_4v08 [Team Europe] confirmed parent set of gameking Dino Adventure Legend was just a bad dump of the good
    one and removed it [Team Europe] confirmed that many of the gameking 4-in-1 dumps are half size, and marked them as such [Team
    Europe, David Haywood] changed tag from supported="no" to supported="partial" on the game king dumps that aren't bad dumps, as
    they appear to be playable without sound.

 * the previous mc_4v19 has been made a clone mc_4v19a and description changed to "4 in 1 - Warrior + Cleverhawk + Valiant +
    MetalDeform ('JUN 16 05', 1MB cartridge)"
 * the new dump is playable, but from a different revision of the cartridge with only 512KB ROM instead of 1MB meaning the dump of
    this one is complete.  Presumably the 1MB versions exist either as bugfixes, or as a crude copy protecton against people with
    512KB flash carts.
 * gameking.xml add cartridge pintout [Team Europe]

    For an example, please see ne555 source.
 * Started migrating to pure C++, i.e. "//" comments.
 * Various documentation fixes.
 * Added cppcheck configuration to netlist/build

-wd1000: save state [68bit]

-swtpc, swtpc09: save state, port change, cleanups [68bit]

-ss50 bus: port change handlers, save state, cleanups. [68bit]
 * Add some port change handlers.
 * Note state to be saved.
 * Canonicalize port names to uppercase.
 * Order baud rate options from lowest to highest.

-qvt102: key lines, boost interleave, [68bit]
 * Key lines need to be logical 'anded' together, for the modifiers and the other keys - if one is pulled low the line is pulled
    low.
 * Replace the use of set_perfect_quantum with a temporary boost_interleave to meet the timing synchronisation between the keyboard
    MPU and the main CPU.
 * Move the resetting of the keyboard state from the reset method to the start method. The keyboad MPU pushes values for these on
    reset anyway so it was redundant.

-Visicom: fixed problem with cartridges, all swlist games now work. [Robbbert]

-Cleaned up Virtal Boy slot code. [Vas Crabb]
 * vboy.xml updates:
 * Set width and endianness for all ROM regions
 * Added width and endianness for SRAM, assuming all cartridges have 8k*32 SRAM for now
 * Removed mirroring - this is an implementation detail
 * Removed "slot" features - there's enough information to work this out anyway
 * bus/vboy updates:
 * Made slot probe software part to determine cartridge type
 * Made cartridges responsible for installing themselves
 * Added support for arbitrary cartridge sizes, assuming simplistic decoding
 * Added support for 8-bit and 16-bit SRAM on LSBs
 * Added support for EXP space and INTCRO output
 * Fixed SRAM not being loaded
 * bus/generic: added a helper for mapping non-power-of-two memory with simple decoding
 * cpu/v810: send I/O accesses to program space if I/O space is unconfigured
 * vboy.cpp: updated for changed slot and CPU code
 * bus/wswan: added notes
 * The Virtual Boy software list is still in pretty poor shape.  It's assuming all carts with SRAM have 8k*32, there are a bunch of
    feature tags for ICs that don't actually give an IC type, making them useless, 3-D Tetris mentions a battery but doesn't have an
    SRAM data area, Virtual Fishing refers to a HY6254ALLJ-10 which isn't a real part (I assume it means HY6264ALLJ-10 which is an
    8k*8 50µA standby SRAM).

-netlist: first steps on the way to calculated parameters. [Couriersud]
 * This commit is a first step towards using formulas in parameters, i.e.
 * MAINCLOCK(clock, 20 * 30)
 * The intention is to improve readability and scalability. Since device registration already provides all necessary information
    about parameters, the code to create an include file for all devices has been improved. Long term, this will remove the need for
    device specific header files.
 * In addition going forward devices will accept either no connections or all specified connections, i.e.
 * TTL_7400_NAND(name, chip1.2, chip2.3)
 * or
 * TTL_7400_NAND(name) NET_C(...) NET_C(...)
 * This will allow to remove all duplicate definitions which are currently necessary, i.e. TTL_7400_NAND/TTL_7400_GATE

 * create fcrash.h
 * change includes, add to arcade.lua

-c64.cpp, c128.cpp: fixed CBM IEC slot address not being set when replacing devices in machine config [Vas Crabb]
 * bus/c64/rex_ep256.cpp: fixed array of EPROM slots not being populated (subdevices don't exist at construction time)
 * having a macro for a device's expected tag in a header is bad - devices should not make assumptions about their tag or their
    location in the system hierarchy
 * device types exist in the global namespace - you must not use overly generic names for them as this is likely to cause collisions
 * device short names and titles each have their own namespace, but they're also global, and it should be possible to work out
    vaguely what a device is from its names
 * POSIX reserves all names ending in "_t" at global scope - we want fewer of these causing potential future issues, not more
 * if your device is in the global namespace, you should name it in a way that's not asking for name collisions to happen
 * we have a simple convention for device class names - it doesn't hurt to follow it:
   - concrete device_t implementations end with "_device"
   - device_interface implementations end with "_interface" (and often start with "device_")
   - abstract classes that derive from device_t end with "_device_base"
 * if you want to give your slot card device classes short, generic names, put them in a namespace for the "bus"
 * if you really want to use names ending with "_t", put them in a namespace or nest them inside a class

-netlist: Proxy and power terminal hack removal. [Couriersud]
 * Devices ttlhigh and ttlhow are no longer automatically created.
 * All logic input devices (e.g. TTL_INPUT, LOGIC_INPUT) now need to have their power terminals (VCC, GND) connected. This opens the
    route for more appropriate proxy devices but comes at a cost. If the connections are omitted your circuit will not work as
    expected. Example: LOGIC_INPUT(I_SD0, 1, "AY8910PORT") NET_C(VCC, I_SD0.VCC) NET_C(GND, I_SD0.GND)
 * Updated all netlists.
 * Removed proxy information from terminal objects. This was replaced by a lookup hash whose life-span does not exceed netlest
    setup.
 * These changes enable the removal of a number of hacks from the source going forward.

 * TRB and TSB perform an extra read of the operand instead of an extra write

-netlist: maintenance and bug fixes, remove DUMMY_INPUT. [Couriersud]
 * Removed DUMMY_INPUT. NC (not connected) pins should now use NC_PIN. If a NC_PIN is actually connected, an error will be logged
    and validation will fail.
 * Enabled "extended" validation. This will catch now if power terminals are not connected.
 * Added const and noexcept where appropriate.

 * If an invalid code is entered (e.g. only negatives) abandon the change rather than cycling default/none
 * If an invalid code is entered display a message until the user takes some other action
 * input.cpp updates:
 * constexpr crusade on input_code and input_seq and some very slight optimisation to input_seq
 * seq_poll* is a frontend function and had no business being in the core, so it's a utility class now
 * seq_poll* now exposes a bit more detail, enabling improved interaction on the UI inputs menu
 * global state is reduced a little, but the poll_* functions are still members of the input manager with global state

-popeye: Add interlaced rendering. [Couriersud]
 * fixes MT05600
 * There are now three rendering modes selectable via machine config:
 * false progressive: same as before.
 * Interlaced (scanline skip): only the current field is drawn with the other field's scanlines blacked. This gives the same
    flickering impression as interlaced display.
 * Interlaced (bitmap): Bitmap is constructed from odd and even fields. Result is comparable to PAL/NTSC videos played back on
    progressive displays without additional processing.
 * Some modernisation, all members initialized in constructor.

-Opengl render driver: fix bug preventing adjustment of ... [Couriersud]
 * gamma, brightness and contrast. Starting MAME with defaults, i.e. gamma == 1.0, no rgb palette will be allocated. If gamma than
    is changed, a new palette will be allocated. But the texture will not be updated because the palette is not checked. This fix
    will check for palette changes. Note: if the palette is changed inplace, i.e. without reallocation, this will fail. The correct
    fix would be that the texture palette is not only a pointer to rgb_t * but to texture_palette_type. texture_palette_type would
    hold the pointer, the length and a sequential id which is checked in addition to pointer equality.

-vt1682.cpp - (plug & play) preliminary sound support added some timers (currently fixed frequency, need to use register) and hook
 up the DACs, which produce slightly crackly sound at the moment in the 'right' channel, need to check why. [DavidHaywood]

-eispc.cpp, mda.cpp: epc LPT device properly installed and is promoted to working I think it is good enough now for floppy boot and
 usage, some configurations were sold without hard disk so promotion is legit as most main board features are supported now. Hard
 disk support and other features will be added later and are all based on ISA cards. [JoakimLarsson]

-vt1682.cpp : map some controls, which work for the 32-in-1 [DavidHaywood]

-ins8250: reverted BAUDOUT pin support and documented findings in eispc.cpp Sadly there were lots if regression side effects of my
 simple attempt to add this feature that I don't have time to sort out at the moment, so I revert it. [JoakimLarsson]

 of as the current implementation in diserial has two timers, one for the rx shifter and one for the tx shifter but 8250 only has
 one clock but diserial doesn't like to have the other clock running when it isn't in use. [JoakimLarsson]

-Remove up to one frame of input latency. [antonioginer]
 * *Remove up to one frame of input latency. Makes MAME virtually lagless on VRR monitors.**
 * MAME has currently two sources of input latency:
 * 1.- Main loop arrangement: inputs are not polled at the optimal moment. 2.- Frame buffering associated to v-sync.
 * Fixing (1) is very straight-forward and is the purpose of this patch. Fixing (2) is a complex task, that requires direct raster
    polling (GroovyMAME) or backend specific features (waitable object swapchain).
 * Modern VRR screens don't require v-sync, so fixing (1) is all we need to get latency as low as it gets.
 * The existing design polls input too early, before throttling:
 * Emulate frame 1
 * Render + poll input
 * Throttle
 * Emulate frame 2
 * ...
 * When it's time is to emulate frame 2, input information is nearly one frame too old. In order to minimize this issue, we need to
    poll input as late as possible, before starting the emulation of frame #2:
 * Emulate frame 1
 * Render
 * Throttle
 * Poll input
 * Emulate frame 2
 * ...
 * Currently input polling is called directly from the video update function. So we need to move that to a separate function so both
    things can be called independently.
 * *Latency tests**
 * In the past, we've done lots of gameplay's input latency measurements from high speed camera footage, using a LED wired to a
    button to get accurate results. This method is extremely time consuming and incovenient.
 * Fortunately, **Radek Dutkiewicz (oomek)** has gently donated one of his prototype **Game Input Lag Testers (G.I.L.T.)**, which
    I'm currently beta-testing. Thanks to this device I can do several latency tests in minutes, accurately tracking how specific
    source changes impact latency.
 * G.I.L.T interfaces with MAME by means of a LUA script: https://github.com/oomek/GILT
 * Here are the results, before and after this modification, on different video backends:
 * ``` latency in ms* before after difference mame64 sf2 -video bgfx -bgfx_backend d3d11 19,99 4,16 15,83 mame64 sf2 -video bgfx
    -bgfx_backend opengl 20,12 4,53 15,59 mame64 sf2 -video bgfx -bgfx_backend vulkan 22,17 6,46 15,71 mame64 sf2 -video d3d
    19,57 4,06 15,51 mame64 sf2 -video opengl   19,55 4,06 15,49 ```
 * 1 frame = 16.77ms
 * Testing system: Windows 10, 1903 AMD Ryzen 7 2700X Radeon RX Vega 56 - Adrenaline 19.9.2 LG 32UD99 (UHD 4K) - Freesync ON
 * Download test results here
 * These tests show a consistent reduction of almost one frame of latency in all renderers. Sub-frame latency figures indicate
    next-frame response, closely matching original hardware behaviour.
 * The longer the emulator stays idle (throttling), the greater latency reduction achieved. In other words, systems that are
    emulated faster will have less latency. The optimal benefit is obtained with v-sync off (e.g. VRR) where all throttling is based
    on CPU.
 * With v-sync on, there's still some potential benefit too, but it depends of how long the emulator stays in throttling, which in
    turn depends on how the game's refresh aligns with the screen's refresh. However, if throttling is disabled with v-sync on
    (-nothrottle -waitvsync), like it's usually done to achieve smooth scrolling, there will be no benefit, since inputs will be
    polled immediately after rendering. Latency figures with vsync-on are terrible nevertheless.
 * Tests have been performed on Windows 10, Linux (Doozer and I) and Mac (keilmillerjr). UWP has not been tested.

-Follow-up to "Cps1 bootlegs, some more new sets #5895" derived class declarations moved out of includes/cps1.h fcrash_state put in
 includes/fcrash.h other class declarations put in the .cpp files per-game derived classes where necessary removed function pointer
 [TwistedTom]

-Plug & Play work (Tv GoGo, Poker inputs etc.) also for spg2xx_io, add machine().describe_context() to more of the logging calls to
 make it more informative for debugging. [DavidHaywood]
 * added all player inputs on Senario Poker, relies on a few hacks for now, but functional.

-Cps1 bootlegs, some more new sets Some new sets in Fcrash: Added captcommb2 - Captain Commando single board bootleg (w/ 2x oki

-workaround to fix cross compilation to x86 from a x64 host Quick workaround to have cross compilation back after genie update.
 Move the MPARAM logic up to execute before PTR64 tests. [tcamargo]
 * Not the best fix, but I'm not willing to rewrite a good part of mame makefile to have a better cross compile setup (I think we
    should differentiate host arch from target arch).
 * See details in https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/5631#issuecomment-552403142.
 * Thanks!

-Cps1 bootleg, new sets + fixes added new Street Fighter II Alpha Magic-F bootleg set (sf2amf3), working added new Saturday Night

 we at least land these improvements given that people have had a look over it and provided constructive feedback. If there are more
 suggestions for the general code then might they be considered here. [68bit]
 * Looking at the schematic, the latch is not cleared in hardware on reset, so would it be most appropriate to not reset it, or is
    the MAME reset method interpreted as resetting latches?

 * The machine works well enough to pass some basic checks and boot the Test Mode. There is no emulation of the sound chip and DSP
    yet.

-Sync bgfx, bx and bimg with upstream; fix the hlsl fs_chroma.sc matrix transposition properly The fact that opengl needs matrices
 transposed is currently being dealt with using a rather ugly way:
 https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/5fac736bf174c76d926081a49d6ac12cc180891c/src/osd/modules/render/bgfx/shaders/chains/hlsl/fs_chroma.sc#L26-L38
 It turns out bgfx has helper functions (mtxFromRows, mtxFromCols, etc.) for exactly this reason. One item remaining to be clarifed
 is metal: current mame code does transpose the matrix [1], but the bgfx helper functions appear not to [2]. The attached zip
 contains the hlsl shader rebuilt with the new code. Please somebody with an access to mac unpack the files over the mame's bgfx
 folder and run ``` mame64 -video bgfx -bgfx_debug -bgfx_backend metal -bgfx_screen_chains hlsl ``` and let me know whether the
 colours are correct? Looking at the git history there is a slight chance that the binary shaders in bgfx/ are not actually built
 with a transposed matrix. Thank you! [belegdol]

-Fix invalid std::vector<> lookup in aviio.cpp This fixes a case where: [npwoods]
 * m_soundbuf_samples == processedsamples
 * processedsamples > 0
 * processedsamples * stream->channels() == m_soundbuf.size()
 * In this scenario, the std::memmove() would do nothing (moving zero bytes), but the operator[] on the second parameter to
    std::memmove() overflows the array.  This can be benign in optimized builds (because the third parameter to std::memmove() is
    0), but on debugging builds this can cause an assert.

-i8251a initilization changed I tracked down my handshake problem between the serial keyboard and the Ericsson PC (epc) and it
 turned out to be a framing error that for some obscure reason did not occur when the keyboard was halted by being suspended by the
 scheduler. [JoakimLarsson]
 * I initially thought it was timing but there is a lot of room for timing differences actually, instead diserial interpreted the
    initial value of rxd as a startbit and produced a framing error when no stop bits were detected.
 * Reading about the differences between 8251 and 8251a the latter actually requires a high bit after reset before the start bit to
    enable the receiver but as we don't differentiate between the variants I changed the initial value of the rxd line to high and
    everything works like a charm.  As it is an input the value is unknown so it shouldn't matter to anything but diserial really.
    Maybe diserial should wait for a high level after reset too?

-galaga: Implement accurate starfield based on reverse eng. 05xx [rhildinger]
 * --------------------------------------------------------------- This commit implements an accurate starfield for Galaga and
    Bosconian based on reverse engineering the Namco 05xx chip. Documentation and notes have been added inline to the code for the
    galaga video driver.
 * Changes in this commit:
 * 1. Regenerates starfield colors based on LFSR state for every frame 2. Pixel accurate to Namco original 05xx 3. Restores one line
    horizontal starfield shift for every 256 vertical pixel shifts 4. Properly handles LFSR reset (_STARCLR) 5. Restores missing 4
    stars from previous implementations 6. Fixes potential issue with the number of stars on screen at any one time 7. Restores 4

-Added two new unreleased Model Racing games Those games was never released by Model Racing to the public. The assembler source
 files for those games where extracted from the original floppy disks used by the former Model Racing developer Adolfo Melilli
 (adolfo@melilli.com). The disks where retrieved by Alessandro Bolgia (xadhoom76@gmail.com) and Lorenzo Fongaro
 (lorenzo.fongaro@virgilio.it) and dumped by Piero Andreini (pieroandreini@gmail.com) using KryoFlux hardware and software.
 Subsequently Jean Paul Piccato (j2pguard-spam@yahoo.com) mounted the images and compiled the source files, managed to set up a
 romset and wrote a mame driver that aims to reproduce in the most faithful way the work of Melilli at Model Racing in late '70s.
 [janniz]
 * The game driver is not based on hardware inspection and is solely derived from assumptions I've made looking at the assembler
    code and comments written into the source files of the games. Several of those hypothesis came following the directions of
    previous yet contemporary Model Racing works (Eg: Claybuster) and where confirmed by Melilli himself.
 * Being unreleased these games do not have an official name, thus the names used in the source files were used instead.
 * In this PR there are also two fixes for the debug wave file generated by the sn76477 device.

-v5x.cpp : Move remappable IO handler into seperated space, Fix remapping IO behavior [cam900]

-swtpc8212: fill in a lot more of this machine This patch gets it running. It adds the MCM66750 character generator, and implements
 the MC6845 row update function. Most of the I/O has been worked out with help from the CT-82 user manual. The various screen
 formats and the graphics modes appear to be working and plausible. Printer support has been added, and a beeper. A generic keyboard
 had been added, but the keyboard will need work. There appear to be keyboard cursor keys that are not implemented. Some of the
 keyboard control codes are not operational, can not be generated. [68bit]
 * The ROMs for this one, with the added MCM66750 ROM, are at: https://68bit.org/swtpc8212.zip
 * I would like to be able to actually connect this to an emulated swtpc machine in mame and is that possible? If not then are there
    any plans to allow these rs232 devices to be connected? Might it be better as a rs232 slot device like the ie15 terminal? Is see
    some other terminals in mame, like the VT100, and it would be nice to be able to use these too, am I missing something?
