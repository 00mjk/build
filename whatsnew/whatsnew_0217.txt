-Improve the ROM labels for the CM-32P based on PCB pictures. [Lord Nightmare, ValleyBell]

-teracre.cpp: Add hide text layer support (used in Cofree break of horekid) [Sasuke]
 * 07494: horekid, horekidb, boobhack: Coffee break doesn't show

-vt1682 - swap bg pen fallthrough for boxing, adjust render/latching timing slightly for racing games, correct spellings.
 [DavidHaywood]

 * bgfx: Fixed Github issues #5830 and #5956. [Ryan Holtz]

-galivan.cpp : Add hide text layer support, and fix text color attlibute (#5957) [sasuke-arcade]

-bgfx: Fix edge case around B/C/G settings. [Couriersud]
 * If e.g. kidniki is started with default gamma (1.0), changing gamma with slider doesn't work. Setting to a gamma <> 1 and
    restarting MAME will apply the gamma. This commit fixes this.

-Opengl: Apply line width provided by renderer. [Couriersud]

-pre-fill things allocated with operator new with 0xcd in debug builds (value can be changed by setting global
 g_mame_new_prefill_byte with a debugger) - this is gonna hurt performance, but it will help catch issues exposed when we remove
 pre-clearing before constructing devices [Vas Crabb]

-machines promoted to WORKING  (Plug & Play / SunPlus - Zone 40) (#5983) [David Haywood]
 * mostly decrypt zone40
 * this gets the graphics in the tile viewer to look mostly correct, and there are neat increasing number sequences in ROM
 * there might still be an additional opcode fetch scramble, and also block scramble (I see no vectors) or possible internal ROM use
    (this came after vt1682, which had internal ROM boot option, but dumps we have don't use it)
 * move zone40 back to vii.cpp

-new NOT WORKING machines (Lexibook) (#5989) [David Haywood]
 * new NOT WORKING machines
   - -- Lexibook JG7425 221-in-1 [TeamEurope]
 * mapping the code from ROM to RAM at 500000 after skipping the first 0x20 bytes means a lot of jumps go to the word after a 'br
    r3' so is probably where it gets copied to

-new WORKING machine (Lexibook 120-in-1) (#5993) [David Haywood]
 * new WORKING machine
   - ------ Lexibook JG7415 120-in-1 [TeamEurope, David Haywood]
 * (weirdly uses a 256MB rom, full of data, but only 128MB of it is for this game, also didn't give 100% consistent reads, asked
    Klaus to check if bad bits are in unused areas, could have been intentional)

-chihiro.cpp: replace Ghost Squad security data with real PIC16 key firmware, dumped from original but non-protected device
 [MajorPBX]
 * note: firmware is same as the one used in NAOMI DIMM PIC16 keys, which means - old rumors about Chihiro uses a bit different
    keys/firmwares - is not correct.

-new machines NOT WORKING (#6007) [David Haywood]
 * ---- Fantasy Story [David Haywood, caius, The Dumping Union]
 * technically it's fully playable, but since there's no sound I've left it as NOT WORKING for now, as first impressions will be
    bad, sound is driven by a PIC.

-osborne1.cpp: [Vas Crabb]
 * Move drawing to scanline update function and get rid of intermediate bitmap

 * namco_c355spr.cpp : Revert vblank related commits

-input_sdl.cpp: Ignore joystick buttons beyond maximum supported number. [Vas Crabb]
 * Note that the code to map excess buttons to switches doesn't actually do anything useful while INPUT_MAX_BUTTONS and MAX_BUTTONS
    happen to be defined to the same number.

-osborne1.cpp updates: [Vas Crabb]
 * Added additional default key mappings on numeric keypad
   - The numeric keypad keys are wired in parallel with the ones on the main keyboard - using shift with them produces punctuation

   - There is no physical backspace key, but CP/M uses the cursor left key for backspace, so it's intutive
 * Clean up code a little and update notes

-plausible hookup for dreamwld MCU (#6075) [David Haywood]
 * also since this, unlike the earlier Semicom games, was the bare minimum code (no game ititle, author, or date in the MCU) I've
    moved the fake protdata regions into MCU code files using the code from dreamwld, and marked them as BAD DUMP, meaning we always
    emulate the MCU here.

-pico.xml/sawatte.xml - Add more scans of book pages From TeamEurope. [FakeShemp]

-leapfrog_leappad_cart.xml - Add Was ist das? von Richard Scarry (Germany) [FakeShemp]
 * The ROM and scans from TeamEurope. I don't have a copy of the ROM dump, only the scans, so I've commented out the ROM part until
    it surfaces.

-hh_sm510: Set 16way flag for gnw games without dpad [algestam]

-Possible workaround for MSVC issue in #6044 This is to see whether the CI server’s Visual Studio 2019 MSVC can compile the code
 with this workaround applied.  There’s no point merging it if it doesn’t go green (see issue #6044). [cuavas]

-sub-class generalplus gpac800, better simulate bootstrap by copying initial code to location in rom header [DavidHaywood]

-Added DIP switches to all Model 2 board per research The current Model 2 driver does not have a DIP switch on the mainboard of most
 games. In fact, only Zero Gunner has it. All Model 2A, B and C boards do have DIP switches, however, and we have found code in
 Virtua Fighter 2, Sonic the Fighters and Fighting Vipers that use the DIP switches to enable debug features. Please see this
 article for more details on that:

-Split C64 disk softlist similarly to Apple II. This PR serves to make a case to split the C64 disk softlist the same way we
 currently have the Apple II softlists: into clean cracks, originals, and misc (homebrew and defaced cracks). [Firehawke]
 * My rationale for this change is that if we continue to dig into the C64 library, we most certainly will run into all three types
    for the same software. Being able to clearly denote which is which and use the same .zip filenames where appropriate will serve
    to make the documentation easier to read for developers and users both.
 * While I have committed a sin by having two empty softlists for the moment, there has been some interest from a MW poster to work
    on these lists and if I can grease the wheels a bit by doing the initial prepwork for them, I'm absolutely in favor of doing
    just that.

    vice versa, but now the emulator can at least access the information and parse it however it wants instead of the info lingering
    in comments.
 * Added more PCB layouts, regions, serials. Some new dumps added and some old corrected with redumps.
