Source Changes
--------------
-Added notes about some Tehkan World Cup hacks. [Roberto Fresca]

-stlforce / mwarr refactoring (#3984) [David Haywood]
 * mwarr.cpp refactoring
 * mwarr.cpp refactoring
 * use suggested syntax, unless there's something to actually modify instead of outright replace?

-PSX GPU: Copy the textures STP bit, which improves Silent Hill. [smf]

-PSX GTE Use count_leading_zeros() & count_leading_ones() instead of counting manually. [smf]

-deco0: dumped 68705 MCU for drgninjab2 [Sean Riddle, Tomas Garcia-Meras (ClawGrip), The Dumping Union]

-Started commandline documents update to dismiss items no longer in source and start listing recently added commands.  More work to
 come.  [Tafoid]

-added crude lamp layout to "Video 21" so that it is actually worthy of the 'Working' tag (game doesn't really let you know what to
 do, it's still vague without a 'deal' lamp, but at least somewhat playable now and I suspect this is how the machine was)
 [DavidHaywood]

-Fix debugger memory view editing for address-shifted spaces [AJR]

-new working clone - Pocket Gal Deluxe (Asia v3.00) [braintro]

-Preliminary emulation of National DP8350 CRT controller family [AJR]

-flkatck.cpp: fix sprite-sprite priorities and removed hackish implementation in k007121 [Angelo Salese, Dink] (#4024)
 [Angelo Salese]
 * flkatck.cpp: fix sprite-sprite priorities and removed hackish implementation in k007121 [Angelo Salese, Dink]

-Video21 marked as NOT WORKING, because it freezes if you win. [Robbbert]

-typo fixes to a couple alt_title lines [killamegagiga]
 * "chestfld" alt_title must have been incorrectly copied from a sales listing as the subtitle read "without box or instructions".
    Replaced with correct subtitle. Added an extra dot to "touch" subtitle to match what is printed on the instruction manual.  The
    box cover only shows one dot but this is due to the line break after the word "of".  In Japanese orthography the dots are
    certainly optional but mixing the dots and no-dots in the same phrase looks awkward.

-bbc_tube_6502/65c102: Added ReCo6502 Tube 1.21 ROM. [Nigel Barnes]

-pcjr.cpp: Add null_modem and terminal to serport options. (#4028) [Thomas Cherryhomes]

-Fix connonical command line option. [tim lindner]

-VGMPLAY: Support extra clocks in extended header, for cases like Super Locomotive that has two chips with different clock speeds.
 [smf]

-Improve file selection search behaviour [Vas Crabb]

-Irem GA20: rewrite sound update [Valley Bell]
 * In all currently supported GA20 sample ROMs, samples are followed by 1 to 16 bytes with value 00. (depends on alignment) Thus I
    assume that this is a sample end marker. The "sample end" register might be used for something else. (looping?)

-support rowscroll on the score layer of cps3, fixes jojoba combo meters [DavidHaywood]

-Add PLDs to "atetrisb2" [ClawGrip, Roberto Fresca, Recreativas.org, The Dumping Union] (#4032) [ClawGrip]

-GENie: support for macOS Mojave (10.14) [R. Belmont]

-Update Twinkle docs to match data gleaned from kits. [DragonMinded]

-cps3 - light cleanups [DavidHaywood]
 * (move some variable definitions to where they're used etc., fix last line of cliprect in new rowscroll code, divide fg draw into
    a function)

-(unrelated, but weclemanb is clearly a hack, mark it as such) [DavidHaywood]

-Emulate PS/2 keyboard/mouse controller - same MCU as AT, but wired differently. [Vas Crabb]

-namcos22: Added viewmatrix reflection. This fixes alpinr2b character selection screen, raveracw and ridgera2 rear-view mirrors, and
 secret mirror track in raveracw. [hap, Ryan Holtz]

-sun4: Changed sun4c to use an 82077 FDC and fixed hookup. Fixes FDC timeout warning in SunOS 4.1.4. [Ryan Holtz]

-cgsix: Added font register and fixed drawing endianness. Improves SunView with cgsix-based cards. [Ryan Holtz]

 * sun4c: Added savestate support. [Ryan Holtz]
 * sun4c: SPARCstation IPX, SLC, 1+ and 2 now boot, but get angry to varying degrees for varying reasons. [Ryan Holtz]

-sun4c: Fixed RAM mirroring with 4 meg sets, and hooked up -ramsize option. [Ryan Holtz]

 * Add "rimrockn12b"
 * Add "Rim Rockin' Basketball (V1.2, bootleg)"

-sun4c: More MMU fixes, makes SPARCstation SLC, IPX and 1+ happier, though not yet completely. [Ryan Holtz]

-combatsc.cpp: fixed video garbage on state loads [Angelo Salese]

-contra.cpp: catch and fix spriteram buffer overflow [Angelo Salese]

-sun4c: Added support for full-width mem_mask on segment map writes, gets Aurora SPARC Linux to 'Booting Linux...' before it dies.

 * On HP9000/300, these modules where always a logical unit connected to the DIO bus. On some systems this was even a seperate DIO
    module. Lets represent this in software. It also cleans up hp9k_3xx.cpp.

-targeth.cpp : Cleanup duplicates, ACCESSING_BITs, naming, Runtime tag lookup [cam900]

-unidasm: Correct endianness of tms9980 and tms9995 [AJR]

-hp9k_3xx: add hp9000/360 [Sven Schnelle]
 * This matches the system i have at home, and with all the latest commits this is the first machine that can boot HP-UX 7 with
    upstream mame. With the C1 bootrom there's still an issue with the SCSI controller, so they can't boot HP-UX (yet).

-tms9914: latch EOI flag until next byte is sent [Sven Schnelle]
 * hp9000/300 sends FEOI directly after the data register write, before the byte is actually transmitted. This leads to the current

-hp_hil: add HP 46060B mouse [Sven Schnelle]
 * move hle_device_base to it's own files
 * add hlemouse.{cpp,h}
 * add mouse device to hp_ipc and hp9k_3xx

-NSCSI: disable debug [Sven Schnelle]
 * The default debug settings are filling up error.log pretty quick when booting SCSI machines like hp9k_3xx. Disable debug in the
    default settings, it can still be enabled if some dev/user wants to debug NSCSI.

-XaviX - Sprite Flpping for Gaplus in namcons2 [DavidHaywood]

-New WORKING clone (#4114) [ClawGrip]
 * New WORKING clone
   - --------------------------------- Tetris (bootleg set 4, with UM3482) [ClawGrip]

 [David Haywood]
 * looking at priorities (not quite right yet)

-hp_hil: various fixes/improvements (#4124) [dxl]

-mips: new skeleton driver [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * A driver for machines made by MIPS Computer Systems, which used MIPS R2000, R3000 and R6000 CPUs and ran RISC/os (a port of UNIX
    System V Release 3). Initial focus is the RC2030 headless workstation. As of this commit, it gets part-way through its I/O
    processor diagnostics with output to a serial terminal.

-x68k_flop: many added info and fix data (except Doujin) [Wayder]

-hp9k_3xx video improvements (#4129) [dxl]
 * 320: the QA-2 ROM version doesn't know about the 98544 332: the internal card is logically a DIO card, so let's use the DIO
    implementation instead of duplicating all the code

-New WORKING clone  (#4127) [ClawGrip]
 * New WORKING clone
   - --------------------------------- Twins [David Torres, ClawGrip, Recreativas.org]
 * It seems that the set from Ecogames is the older and original version, and that Electronic Devices later licensed it. There are
    also some other ED licensed games from Ecogames: http://www.tilt.it/deb/edevg-en.html The games shows 1993, and the PCB is also

-r9751: Implement proper SMIOC emulation through new uart emulation (#4188) [Brandon Munger]
 * [R9751] (Squashed) Early work on SMIOC emulation
 * commit 9b587be762abfd576e92792c612cd205c570924d Author: Stephen Stair <sgstair@akkit.org> Date:   Tue Apr 10 19:41:55 2018 -0700
 * Connected SMIOC DMA to 68k
 * SMIOC now reading bytes for serial from the 68k memory space successfully.
 * commit 0f801a05a3fa5b78768a1a2bcb9981466e8f2b0e Author: Stephen Stair <sgstair@akkit.org> Date:   Tue Mar 27 18:31:32 2018 -0700
 * 68k now running in lockstep with SMIOC for serial
 * 68k now uses actual SMIOC as source of SMIOC status, so it waits for the SMIOC to complete commands before continuing.
 * SMIOC DMA controllers now being asked to move bytes around
 * "write character" (4100) commands to SMIOC are now completing and resulting in correct status being written and sent back to the
    68k
 * Every now and then the SMIOC stalls for a bit, it seems to be due to spending some time trying to communicate with the 8051 CPU
    (used to communicate with another cpu on the serial breakout box) that is not currently present in the emulated device.
 * Next Steps:
 * We're going to move the terminal from the r9751 into the SMIOC, and hook it up to the DMA controllers as a hacky temporary
    solution.
 * We need to emulate the 5xxxx memory range in SMIOC to proxy data to/from the 68k memory
 * Then we'll start work on emulating the octal uart properly and hooking it up to RS232 channels.
 * commit ca91614fca3f43d87755d0c3439521276d7bfafb Author: Stephen Stair <sgstair@akkit.org> Date:   Wed Mar 14 19:52:04 2018 -0700
 * Tinkering to get SMIOC further along
 * 1) Enable 188 cpu to advance DMA immediatley if DRQ is held high when source synchronous DMA is started (It's not clear whether
    the DMA actually works this way yet) 2) Retrigger the DMA DRQ when a memory access is made to the DMA window (future work needed
    to proxy the reads/writes to the 68k's main memory) This is needed to support multibyte DMA reads/writes to the 68k window. 3)
    Reverse the bytes in the status register (based on current incomplete understanding of how this is encoded) 4) Connect the
    status register back to the r9751 on SMIOC status read Current state: SMIOC's main board DMA state machine now completes the DMA
    transfer from the main board (With incorrect data), but we are still getting stuck. Next steps: SMIOC is now hanging waiting on
    DMA to UART to complete, we need to implement some emulation of the UART and its connections to the surrounding 16 dma channels
    in order to make progress.

 * Hacky emulation of SMIOC

 * commit 376bca90dff311d24e1f5014d8d6f0dc297bf671 Author: Stephen Stair <sgstair@akkit.org> Date:   Sun Jan 28 18:31:38 2018 -0800
 * Experimenting with SMIOC emulation
 * Partial fixes for line state issues with persistent line values
 * When the AM9517 DMA controller mode is updated to change the polarity of DACK/DREQ, it doesn't update the DACK line values /
    request values (respectively). This fixes this issue for one of the emulated devices in the file, but the other device has the
    same problem.
 * Add skeleton of SCC2698B UART device
 * Early progress on emulating SCC2698B Octal UART
 * Core structure for IO lines and writing registers is in place.
 * Update address maps to new format.
 * SCC2698b: Add tx/rx, baud rate generation
 * Emulation improvements for scc2698b device
 * MPP output pins emulated
 * Improved logging for baud rate changes
 * Channel configuration emulated
 * Support for TX/RX Enable
 * Started integrating new features into SMIOC
 * Minor progress on the path to enabling new UART for SMIOC
 * Resolved code issues related to upstream changes
 * Working around an apparent problem with callbacks on sub-device devices
 * Terminal added for serial port attached to SCC2698B UART.
 * Things compile and seem to work.
 * SMIOC: Serial is now outputting correctly through emulated SMIOC
 * Some glitches to work out, but this is nearly ready.
 * AM9517a should not forget about input line status on master reset.
 * Disable tracing
 * SMIOC: Improving diagnostics and making some progress on the emulation
 * Revised tracing in SMIOC and SCC2698B
 * Improved tracing approach in r9751
 * Minor progress towards working SMIOC emulation.
 * [R9751] Update drivers  to new code patterns after rebase
 * Rebased on latest mame, Fixed a few issues and updated the callback code patterns based on recent changes in devcb
 * [R9751] Improve logging, fix interrupt race
 * Serial no longer drops output characters
 * [R9751] Working on SMIOC emulation
 * Improved SMIOC emulation accuracy, Made some progress in getting through the disktool initialization sequence, but we are still
    hitting a problem - It looks like disktool should be resetting the SMIOC board when it starts, but the mechanism for this has
    not been found.
 * [R9751] Improve tracing for system board registers
 * [R9751] Improve SMIOC emulation
 * Still having some trouble with SMIOC but this seems to be an improvement. SMIOC is now waiting for a status to be read before
    applying a new status, and mandatory parameter read logic is in place.
 * [R9751] Incremental emulation improvements
 * the SMIOC failure was understood and fixed, and a new approach to getting the hardware to bootstrap correctly was implemented -
    Still having some problems with it though.
 * [R9751] Fixed emulation issues
 * Disktool now boots to the console
 * UART receive only partly working, I don't think it's fully connected yet.
 * [R9751] Further progress on SMIOC emulation
 * Figured out the missing command parameter interface to the SMIOC board
 * Still blocked because the SMIOC interface to the breakout board through an onboard 8051 is not emulated and the disktool software
    depends on properties coming from it.
 * [R9751] Terminal is fully working for disktool
 * Improved the emulation of the 80188 to 451 connection in order to reliably set a status bit disktool depends on.
 * [R9751] Fix build after rebase
 * [R9751] Cleanup, tracing improvements
 * Remove second emulated terminal - SMIOC is now stable enough to run the terminal.
 * Remove older and unnecessary emulation/tracing code
 * r9751: Fix compile error and modify copyright holders

-Work around to change default to show one screen on the coco3 driver. Solves issue #4047. [tlindner]

-General CoCo Cartridge Fixes This fixes Zumwalt bank switching implemented in cartridges when used with all the CoCos. This fixes
 the 32k external cartridge ROM mode on the CoCo 3. (Issue #2746) Software lists are not broken, but they are also not required. If
 you map in the right hardware with the right ROM it will work. [tlindner]

-HLSL Color Transforms and 3D LUT I have added a 3D LUT shader as well as a shader which allows control of the chromaticity of
 phosphors. This allows color management for any arbitrary color space in MAME without needing ICC files and CPU-dependent ICC
 transforms. The limitation is that the working space is limited to sRGB, but this is of no consequence for now. [anikom15]
 * For calibration, generate a 64x64x64 3D LUT in 8-bit PNG format with calibration software (such as DisplayCal) and place it in
    the artwork directory. Use the _bgfx_lut_ option for BGFX and the _lut_texture_ and _ui_lut_texture_ options for D3D9. The
    _lut_enable_ and _ui_lut_enable_ options have been provided for turning the LUTs on and off in D3D9. The source color space for
    the LUT should be sRGB or BT.709.
 * For color correction, I've provided three fundamental color modes that adapts the RGB channels before transformation. The primary
    motivation for this was to make it easy to work with monochrome games without needing to modify the drivers. In _monochrome_
    mode, each channel is multiplied by a conversion factor and then they are summed to make a single channel Y. In _dichrome_ mode
    the R and G channels are multiplied by the conversion factor and summed, and the B channel is left unchanged resulting in a YB
    signal. In _trichrome_ mode the RGB signals are left unchanged. The conversion gains are a parameter that the user may modify.
 * The phosphor shader was moved to apply at this point, to allow for the persistence trails to match the color of the phosphors
    which are processed in the next stage.
 * The chroma shader was added to transform the signals to XYZ according to given phosphor chromaticities and then to sRGB for
    display. Up to a three phosphor space is supported, but not all three phosphors are required to be used. In monochrome mode,
    each phosphor is excited by the same signal, Y. In dichrome mode, the first two phosphors, A and B, are excited by the Y signal
    while the C phosphor is affected by the B signal. In trichrome mode, phosphors A, B, and C correspond to R, G, and B. The
    phosphor gain controls are used to set the white point. The following R function can be used to get the gain parameters for a
    given white point: ```r calc_y_gain <- function(w, r, g, b) { y <- c(w[1] / w[2], 1, (1 - w[1] - w[2]) / w[2]) c1 <- c(r[1] /
    r[2], 1, (1 - r[1] - r[2]) / r[2]) c2 <- c(g[1] / g[2], 1, (1 - g[1] - g[2]) / g[2]) c3 <- c(b[1] / b[2], 1, (1 - b[1] - b[2]) /
    b[2]) A <- matrix(c(c1, c2, c3), nrow = 3, ncol = 3) solve(A) %*% y } ``` Where w, r, g, and b are vectors containing the x and
    y chromaticity coordinates for the white point, and red, green, and blue primaries, respectively.
 * Also included are examples in the ini/ directory which contain a number of common color spaces and individual phosphors. These
    settings can be easily copied into an ini file. I also updated the INI presets. The example files will hopefully help explain
    how the shaders operate where my own explanations have fallen short.

 * This addresses a small issue Tafoid pointed out to me.

-Update Twinkle docs to match data gleaned from kits. I went through all of my kits and updated the table at the top of twinkle.cpp
 with information off of each of them. I unmarked the undumped variants as DU says its all dumped (I have dumps of them all as well
 if needed, unsure how people might want them). Also updated documentation in todo section for how to get 1st style to pass DVD
 checks. [DragonMinded]

-support rowscroll on the score layer of cps3, fixes jojoba combo meters [DavidHaywood]

-Add PLDs to "atetrisb2" [Tomas Garcia-Meras, Roberto Fresca, Recreativas.org, The Dumping Union]

-Fix canonical command line option. I found a bug in the handling of command line media options. [tlindner]
 * When adding a second serial port (null_modem) to the CoCo drivers, the user interface (and -listmedia) reported the media options
    as bitbanger1 and bitbanger2. This is correct.
 * But the command line would not recognize the option bitbanger1. The switches exposed were bitbanger and bitbanger2. This seemed
    to be an error.
 * I found the problem in emuopts.cpp, get_full_option_names(). It was adding the canonical name for the first option only if the
    image_type() matched the instance_name().
 * In the case of a cartridge port, this would compare "cartridge" with "cartridge". It would then construct the canonical name
    "cartridge1" and make it available to the command line.
 * In the case of serial ports the function compared "bitbanger" to "serial". And it would not add "bitbanger1" to the command line
    option.
 * I changed the function to test the canonical name to the non-canonical name. If they are the same (for example cartridge2) it
    will not add a redundant name to the command line options.
 * But if they are not the same (for example: "cartridge") it will use the supplied canonical name for the command line option.

-Irem GA20: rewrite sound update This pull request rewrites the sound update routine in order to [ValleyBell]
 * clean up the code (for-loop instead of manually inlining update code for each channel)
 * use value 0 as sample terminator, because that is apparently what was intended The current code plays from (start) to (end -
    0x20) and the magic 0x20 just makes no sense. I checked all currently supported GA20 sample ROMs to make sure that the change
    doesn't break anything.

-Add null_modem and terminal to serport options. Add null_modem and terminal to serial port options for ibmpcjr driver. [tschak909]

-HP9825 emulation added Hi, this is the first release of hp9825b emulator. It's not finished but it's usable. More features to come
