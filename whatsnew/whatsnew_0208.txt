-Fix problem with bac06 NW [bmcphail]
 * The previous emulation logic change was correct, however Sly Spy, Hippodrome, Birdy Try suffered from an ordering bug -
    tilemap.cpp in the core cached the tile indices before the game updated the dynamic colmun/row major bit.  It seems the correct
    fix is to make sure tilemap::mappings_update() should be called when the column/row bit changes, however this is currently a
    private function.  I've put in a hack at line 396 so that mappings_update() is called as a side effect of a flip.  The better
    fix would be just to expose mappings_update for general driver use, but I didn't want to make that larger change without
    approval.

-tms9900, tms9980a, tms9995: CRU addressing change [AJR]
 * Shift all CRU addresses by 1 in memory maps. This makes CRU addressing more consistent with both register values and external
    address lines. (CRUOUT is multiplexed with the lowest address line on the 8-bit bus versions.)
 * Addressing for CRU read accesses is now the same as it has been for CRU write accesses: one address for each bit. This simplifies
    the CPU cores (which were already emulating bit access times), though it means some read handlers now have to do some additional
    work.
 * CRU space is now little-endian, despite the big-endian memory organization, because less significant bits correspond to lower CRU
    addresses.

-Atari pokey performance II (#4702) [Andreas Müller]
 * pokey: rename pokey_device::m_output -> pokey_device::m_out_raw
 * There is a variable pokey_device::pokey_channel::m_output. Two variables with same name in close context but complete different
    maning are not exactly helpful to understand the code.
 * renaming pokey_device::pokey_channel::m_output was not an option because this would damage stored machine states - right?
 * Signed-off-by: Andreas Müller <schnitzeltony@gmail.com>
 * pokey: rework for performance enhancements
 * Profiling with valgrind pointed to the following hotspot:
 * pokey_device::step_one_clock / line 686-689: | for (int ch = 0; ch < 4; ch++) | { |  sum |= (((((m_channel[ch].m_output ^
    m_channel[ch].m_filter_sample) || (m_channel[ch].m_AUDC & VOLUME_ONLY)) ? (m_channel[ch].m_AUDC & VOLUME_MASK) : 0 )) << (ch *
    4)); | }
 * First solution was to move bit-shifting to first part of ?-part:
 * | sum |= (((m_channel[ch].m_output ^ m_channel[ch].m_filter_sample) || (m_channel[ch].m_AUDC & VOLUME_ONLY)) ?
    ((m_channel[ch].m_AUDC & VOLUME_MASK) << (ch * 4)) : 0);
 * because shifting 0 does not change value. Performance measurements showed improvements but they were not satisfying exactly
    (change is part of this patch).
 * So I thought more of what this piece of code is about:
 * it is run at high frequency (@starwars: 1.5MHz * 4 pokey instances * 4 channels -> ~6MHz) => that is creating the high CPU cycle
    consumption
 * frequency of output change is in a range of (double) audible frequencies (few kHz). => there are long sequences creating
    identical output
 * the sum value calculated depends on few channel input variables: m_output / m_filter_sample / m_AUDC
 * This patch suggests a solution which keeps track of possible input variable change and as long as they don't change there is no
    need to render output sum.
 * The following tests were performed:
 * mame64 -bench 50 starwars: Average speed increases from ~430 to ~490 on my PC
 * on screen profiling shows ~2% idle win
 * starwars, missile-command and marble-madness do not show any audible artefacts
 * Signed-off-by: Andreas Müller <schnitzeltony@gmail.com>
 * pokey: rework prescaler handling
 * CLK_1 does not have a prescaler so there is no need to increment and reset m_clock_cnt[CLK_1]
 * Unroll other prescalers: It gives performance win and reading is easier.
 * Function tests: on missile/starwars
 * Performance test: mame64 -nothrottle starwars Before: Average speed: 409.36% (21 seconds) After: Average speed: 447.37% (21

-specpls3_flop.xml: DSKs from latest TOSEC DATs (#4724) [ICEknigh7]
 * Latest TOSEC additions
 * These changes add most of the DSKs featured in the latest TOSEC DAT files which, according to Lady Eklipse, include all files
    that were in TOSEC and all files from www.worldofspectrum.org which were never in TOSEC before. Which file and update they come
    from is commented for each entry, so that they can be consulted.
 * Files removed:
 * Files marked as "bad dumps" which have a "good" parent set.
 * Trained games, except for a "cheat version" of Neighbours which may have come from the original developers.
 * 80-track (3.5'') disk images.
 * Files generated with the ZXZVM interpreter.
 * Games from the Crap Games Competition.
 * All the DSK files which have a corresponding IPF have been labeled as "alt" clones until they're confirmed to come from the exact
    same release and can be safely removed (there's an added disclaimer about it in each of these entries, to make them easy to
    locate). Other alt versions not in World of Spectrum have been kept for the same reason, since the exact source of each file
    doesn't seem to be properly documented anywhere, which means they'd need some research before a safe removal.
 * Notes about the known DSK dumps:
 * Some dumps may come with an empty Side B, which is technically correct for games which were released with an empty side on
    purpose. These were usually labeled as "Sin grabar para tu uso" ("Unrecorded for your use") in many Spanish releases.
 * Some of the "master disks" from Zeppelin Games share the same file (same SHA-1) for their Side B. This has been verified against
    the downloads available in World of Spectrum.
 * A few releases had a version for a different system on the other side. These have been commented out but not removed, for
    reference.
 * I'm listing here some unofficial/homebrew disk collections which may or may not qualify to be included, so that you can decide
    their fate:
 * "Javier Herrera Games Collection": A bunch of well-known commercial games put in many disks. "Jesus Tejero Software Collection":
    48K games ported to many disks. "Jesus Tejero Tools Collection": This disks include a bunch of utilities for +3 disks such as an
    "autoload sector creator", some of which I haven't found outside the compilations. Might be useful when testing disk emulation?
    "MicroByte - Serie Clasicos Spectrum": Disk copies of the "Clásicos Spectrum" collection of 48K/16K cassettes. I don't think any
    of them were officially made available in disk form. "Recopilacion Vives": Disk ports of three unreleased games which also have
    their own TZX already. "Complex Oldfield Trilogy": This lets you choose between three Mike Oldfield albums, loads a title screen
    depending on which you chose and plays renditions of the tracks in them. "Gary Lancaster Tools Collection": I can't load this
    one, maybe it has some copy protection or something. Haven't found any info about it.

-fix for (imgtool) filtbas when strings left unterminated in basic lines if a basic line didn't terminate a string with a closing

 fail to parse the first token on the following line (behaving as if it were still parsing a string from the previous line).
 [tomctomc]

-mc6845.cpp: Check for vsync on frame reset only if vsync witdh is supported [AmatCoder]
 * Regression caused by 12d8a146 (see comments there).

-bsmt2000: fix 4-bit ADPCM sample playback The BSMT2000 audio board has support for 12 sound channels; 11 of them are for playing
 back signed 8-bit PCM, and the remaining one is for a custom 4-bit ADPCM format. Previously, ADPCM samples would not play back at
 all, or clip out the entire audio stream. [moralrecordings]
 * Originally, tms_rom_w loaded a single byte from the sample ROM and sign-extended it to 16 bits. From looking at the DSP code, the
    problem for ADPCM is that the sample is required to be in the high byte; the DSP uses the midpoint of the 32-bit accumulator
    register to slice the sample into two nibbles. Regular PCM playback still worked (at 1/256th the expected amplitude!), but was
    extra quiet and a bit distorted at low volumes.
 * This patch changes tms_rom_w to shift-extend each sample, and removes the gain boost on the audio output. Fixes a number of
    missing samples/severe audio glitches in Tattoo Assassins (e.g. the bird call in the jungle level).

-Fix for 6809 disassembly fixed bug in 6809 disassembler where the pc was not being incremented correctly for one particular indexed
 addressing case (it so happens the first instruction executed when running "mame cocoe -d" exhibited this bug).  looks like just an
 oversight since it is correctly implemented elsewhere nearby for similar cases. [tomctomc]
 * also, the indexed addressing member function was misnamed "indirect" (guessing it's just a typo since the flag is IND for this
    mode).  i went ahead and changed the name of indirect() to indexed() in the 6809 disassembly header/source (this done in a
    separate commit from the above fix).
 * added a change to use the absolute address in the operand for pc relative indexed addressing (where the assembler computes the
    offset).  i found that several 6809 assemblers *required* this even if using ",PC" instead of ",PCR" which meant the
    disassembled code simply would not assemble correctly at all before this change.
 * added a change to force extended addressing (via the ">" operand syntax) in cases where the given address were only one byte in
    length (in this case, many assemblers would simply choose to use direct addressing instead).  again, the goal was to make the
    disassembly able to re-assemble exactly as before the disassembly.

 * Notes about the known DSK dumps:
 * Some dumps may come with an empty Side B, which is technically correct for games which were released with an empty side on
    purpose. These were usually labeled as "Sin grabar para tu uso" ("Unrecorded for your use") in many Spanish releases.
 * Some of the "master disks" from Zeppelin Games share the same file (same SHA-1) for their Side B. This has been verified against
    the downloads available in World of Spectrum.
 * A few releases had a version for a different system on the other side. These have been commented out but not removed, for
    reference.
 * I'm listing here some unofficial/homebrew disk collections which may or may not qualify to be included, so that you can decide
    their fate:
 * "Javier Herrera Games Collection": A bunch of well-known commercial games put in many disks. "Jesus Tejero Software Collection":
    48K games ported to many disks. "Jesus Tejero Tools Collection": This disks include a bunch of utilities for +3 disks such as an
    "autoload sector creator", some of which I haven't found outside the compilations. Might be useful when testing disk emulation?
    "MicroByte - Serie Clasicos Spectrum": Disk copies of the "Clásicos Spectrum" collection of 48K/16K cassettes. Only a selection
    of these was officially made available in disk form. "Gary Lancaster Tools Collection": I can't load this one, maybe it has some
    copy protection or something. Haven't found any info about it.

-witch.cpp : Correct foreground tilemap and bankswitching behavior, Fix some naming [cam900]

-OSD/OpenGl: Improve performance by moving calculations out of loop This one was triggered by batman. [schnitzeltony]

-Linux X11 Input: Fix lightgun support SDL/X11 number mouse/lighgun buttons 1,2,3, while windows and other parts of MAME like
 offscreen_reload expect 0,2,1. Transpose buttons 2 and 3, and then [kiall]
 * 1 the button number to align the numbering schemes.
 * This fixes lightgun support on Linux - tested with an Ultimarc AimTrak and the following config:
 * lightgun                  1 lightgun_device           lightgun lightgunprovider          x11 lightgun_index1           "Ultimarc
    Ultimarc" offscreen_reload          1
 * Note: MAME must be compiled with XInput support:
 * make -j10 NO_USE_XINPUT=0
 * Fixes bug #4695
 * With these changes, Lightguns on linux are perfectly accurate (well, as accurate as the gun itself allows... I miss real
    lightguns ;))

-vsmile_cd.xml: Replace CHDs created from CloneCD images with new ones created from standard redump.org images [redump.org,

-tms9900, tms9980a, tms9995: CRU addressing change [ajrhacker]
 * Shift all CRU addresses by 1 in memory maps. This makes CRU addressing more consistent with both register values and external
    address lines. (CRUOUT is multiplexed with the lowest address line on the 8-bit bus versions.)
 * Addressing for CRU read accesses is now the same as it has been for CRU write accesses: one address for each bit. This simplifies
    the CPU cores (which were already emulating bit access times), though it means some read handlers now have to do some additional
    work.

I'm happy enough with the emulation of this to promote it.  There is one button I haven't been able to map which is market
  'metronome' and should produce an audible beat. [DavidHaywood]
The overall input mapping is quite messy and could probably be tidied up, but I'm not sure there is a standard way to map something
  with so many inputs (it's just abusing multiple player inputs to get enough buttons) at least where everything is has been
  identified. [DavidHaywood]
Jumping Popira [Sean Riddle, Peter Wilhelmsen, ShouTime, David Haywood]
Game & Watch: Parachute [Henrik Algestam]
Haven't been able to find any built-in cheats for this game. It could be that there either aren't any or that I setup the port
  config wrong when testing for cheats. The only functionality found is some sort of alarm test that can be enabled on R3 port 4.

looks like Spider-Man is SPG110 or similar, die appears to be the same, does things a little different to Pinball, so might just be
