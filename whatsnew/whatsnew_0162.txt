 [Mike Naberezny]

-DEC Rainbow updates: [Karl-Ludwig Deisenhofer]
 * Hard disk R/W support and real-time clock support emulating
    ClikClok card.
 * wd2010: provides IRQ / (B)DRQ signals. Honors DRIVE_READY and WRITE
    FAULT (DRDY / WF) now. Set WF to GND and DRDY to VCC in your
    driver if signals are not serviced.

 * Own Kryoflux reads

-Breakout: Hooked up antenna and free game dip switch as well. [Couriersud]

-added E0C6200 cpu skeleton [hap]

-gambl186: Worked a complete set of inputs + DIP switches, fixed the
 CPU frequency, added findings and tech notes. Now the four games could
 be selected. Roulette, Bingo and Black Jack are playable. Casino 10
 (poker) needs the watchdog implemented to work properly. Also changed
 the game name to Multi Game (Vxxx). [Roberto Fresca]

-VT240 and VT320: add links to DEC-O-LOG service notes for
 different firmware changes, add firmware version numbers.
 [Lord Nightmare]

-Netlist: [Couriersud]
 * improved 9312 device ==> 20% speed increase
 * remove netlist_state_t ==> no added value
 * removed dead code in solver
 * various minor modifications
 * performance monitoring now also displays stats for subdevices
 * fixed save-state issues 
 * fixed save state in 9312
 * Added EXTCLOCK which can generate arbitrary timing patterns.
 * Use two EXTCLOCKs to replace timing circuit (9316) in breakout. This
   gives a speed increase from 60% to 75%. 

-Mini.Boy 7: Added lamps and a internal button-lamps layout based on
 the cabinet pictures. Lamps are currently disabled due to other
 unknown writes are happening on the same port. Need more
 investigation. Also added the coin counter. [Roberto Fresca]

-Multi Game (EGD): Sounds are 4-bit ADPCM driven by a NEC D7759GC.
 Hooked preliminary sound routines. Needs more work. [Roberto Fresca]

 somewhat playable [Peter Ferrie]

-corrections to gtfore sets [Brian Troha]

-n64: 50% RDP speedup on an i7-5930K [MooglyGuy]

-MAME now represent full build, for building MESS drivers only use 
 make SUBTARGET=mess, for building only Arcades
 drivers only use: make SUBTARGET=arcade [Miodrag Milanovic] 

-Adjust breakout layout to fit screen boundaries. Changed lights to be
 be circles. [Couriersud]

-Downsizing ... Removed netlist_ttl_input_t and netlist_ttl_output_t.
 The logic family is governed by the chip and defaults to TTL. However
 individual devices may change the logic family of their inputs and
 outputs as well. Implementing special output/input characteristics of
 "S", "LS", "HC", ... you name it, devices is now pretty easy.
 Theoretically e.g. a "LS_HighPrecision" proxy could be used to model
 the output down to the transistor level. [Couriersud]

-zaxxon.c: Use SN76489A for sound as shown on congo bongo 
 schematic [Lord Nightmare]

-sigmab98: Implemented sprite rotation [Luca Elia]

-HLSL shader improvements [Jezze]
 * changed shadow mask implementation, shadow count XY now represent
    the number of pixel the shadow UV sized tiles will take on the
    screen
 * implemented rotation of the shadow mask texture depending on the
    default landscape or portrait view of the screen
 * removed prescale and pixel border of the shadow mask texture
 * added option to change the shadow UV offset, to reduce the color
    bleeding of the shadow mask
 * adjusted presets to work with the changed mask implementation
 * reduced defocus offset
 * improved downsampling for better blurring
 * improved alignment of bloom layers (raster and vector)
 * applied bloom effect to the render output of screenshot and AVI
    recording
 * changed curvature effect to fit screen size
 * changed scanlines to be not rendered into bloom layers
 * changed shadow mask to be not rendered into bloom layers
 * changed color floor to not light the bloom layers
 * changed shadow mask to not dark the color floor
 * added image vignetting simulation and option
 * added round screen corner simulation and option
 * added screen light reflection simulation and option
 * made usage of unused brightness offset (additive)
 * removed unused pincushion option
 * removed duplicate shadow count Y options
 * removed artwork/adapture.png
 * added artwork/adapture-grill.png
 * added artwork/shadow-mask.png
 * added artwork/slot-mask.png
 * added hlsl/simple.fx
 * removed unused shaders::blit() function
 * added shaders::screen_pass() function, which handles the
    (raster-)rendering on screen, into screenshot and AVI recording
 * added effect:set_bool() function
 * fixed usage of OrientationSwapXY shader parameter
 * added RotationSwapXY shader parameters to consider the user defined
    screen rotation
 * added missing RotationSwapXY shader paramter
 * fixed curvature zoom to fit the screen size in any aspect ratio
 * fixed black border on the right and bottom side of the screen,
    caused by the previously added rounded corners
 
-gameking.xml: added dump of one multigame cart. [TeamEurope]

-leapster.xml: added a few new dumps. [TeamEurope]

-msx: started adding disk images to msx1_flop.xml and msx2_flop.xml,
 based on preliminary partial work by Riley110 [Fabio Priuli]

-Update palette in 315_5124.c [nitrofurano]

-Netlist:
 * Fixed soft reset due to wild BJT_SW oscillations
 * Downsized nld_signal.h to one template
 * Some minor changes improving performance by some notches.
 * Always compile nl_asserts to avoid bit rot.
 * Adjusted monitor gain for breakout. [Couriersud]

-Finally got USE_DEACTIVE_DEVICE to work with breakout as well. This
 adds about 10% to 20% performance. In addition, increased timing
 accuracy for deactivated devices. However still, there may be timing
 inaccuracies which certain circuits may not tolerate. Disabled for
 now. [Couriersud]

-clifront.c: Slightly optimized -romident so that each software list is
 parsed only once instead of as many times as the number of drivers it
 is attached to. Also, removed the implication that files with (size !=
 power of 2) are to be skipped, since we now want to identify also
 tapes and floppies and not only ROM binaries. [Fabio Priuli]

-Added netlist-level parameter NETLIST.USE_DEACTIVATE. Device
 deactivation optimisations can now be enabled within the netlist
 provided the circuit can deal with them. [Couriersud]

-Added truthtable implementations to a number of devices. The
 combination of device activation, usage of GCC PMF extensions and
 truthtables brings breakout to 95% speed up from about 75%. Fixed
 NE555 initial state. [Couriersud]

-abc802, abc806, abc1600: Fixed invalid data transmitted on
 first keypress. [Curt Coder]

-Some netlist bugfixes:
 * Savestate works
 * Truthtable device deactivation fixed
 * Truthtable ignore mask is now determined by a better approach
    identifying more ignore possibilities.

- N64: Improve blender performance. [MooglyGuy]

-savquest: WIP [Peter Ferrie]
 * hooked up Voodoo 2 device
 * switched to DS12885 device for proper CMOS size
 * moved Voodoo register base to proper place
 * implemented Voodoo-specific PCI registers to pass Glide validation
 * increased frame-buffer size to enable 640x480 resolution
 * hooked up ISA bus and SoundBlaster 16 device
 * extended HASP emulation to return product information
 * documented HASP behaviour

-gambl186: further improvements to EEPROM behaviour [Peter Ferrie]

-peplus.c: Added correct CG2228 graphics roms to the Multi-Poker
 XM00008P set. [BrianT, PowderMaker]

-Fix text color and wrong sprite flip x based on game footage [Luca Elia]

-Removed all uses of setjmp.h in MAME. The only place where it is still
 referenced is cpu/powerpc/ppc.c. I couldn't find any case in which
 this file would be compiled using the current build system.
 Nonetheless documented use using PPC_H_INCLUDED_FROM_PPC_C define.
 [Couriersud]

-TLCS-90 CPU: Fixed TRUN bit masking (timers start/stop)
 [Rainer Keuchel]

-More progress on SPICE to netlist conversion. nltool can now convert
 simple SPICE netlists e.g. from LTSpice to netlist format.
 [Couriersud]

-n64: Improve RDP speed by eliminating some unneeded code. [MooglyGuy]

-abc806: Implemented flashing, double height, and underlined
 characters by hooking up the RAD PROM. [Curt Coder]

-gameboy: more updates to the cart emulation [Tauwasser]
 * fixed some MBC1, MBC2 details
 * added MMM01 notes on registers
 * fixed Sachen MMC1 implementation so that Sachen logo is properly
    displayed
 * started work on the emulation of Sachen MMC2 mapper

-Rewrote the MOS6532 RIOT.  [Curt Coder]

-Bump version on *nix man pages. [Cesare Falco]

-n64: RDP - remove threaded waits to increase performance. [MooglyGuy]

-cgenie: Rewrote driver and removed lots of cruft [Dirk Best]
 * Remove custom 6845 emulation and use our standard core
 * Use the slot system for the parallel interface, fix and implement
    the joystick as a slot device and create a printer slot device
 * Add support for the RS-232 port
 * Add support for the Break key (causes NMI)

-abc80: Default to ABC 830 disk drive with fast controller. [Curt Coder]
