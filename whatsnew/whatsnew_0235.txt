  requests.

8333: QX10 fix graphics scrolling [brijohn]
Update: Dropped second patch as I now have a better and more complete implementation of the the upd7220 draw_char routine. 
Reduces the QX10 video memoy allocation to 128k instead of 256k and setups mirroring in the memory map.
With these patches the following mfbasic program now works properly.
```
   10 print "Hello World!"
   20 goto 10
```
 Also running the diag disk in color mode now sucessfully works on the final scrolling text test.

Bangkok Knights (Activision) [C64 Ultimate Tape Archive V2.0]
Basket Master (Imagine) [C64 Ultimate Tape Archive V2.0]
As discussed on my earlier PR #8331, this follow up PR contains a small number of new software list entries with the intent of
  raising standards going forward.
My proposal to improve standards considers the following:
1. software name / rom name keeping to the 8.3 / 16.3 filename formats for consistency
2. software name / rom name all lowercase letters and no use of spaces
3. description, publisher, release year, alt_title metadata fields populated correctly as required
4. use of clones (latest release to be considered the original version)
5. where software list has more than one .tap file due to different cassette sides (A and B) or multiple cassettes (1, 2, etc.), the
  rom name contains cassette number / side in brackets (e.g. (a) is for cassette side A, (2b), is for cassette no. 2 side B)
Please review proposal and let me know your thoughts.  Thanks in advance.

8379: Upd7220 area fill rework [brijohn]
These patches fix some issue in the implementation of the upd7220 GPU.
1. The first patch fixes the adress space to use a -1 address shift so that is actually word adressable. Without this the total
  amount of memory addressable was only 256k but the actually device should be able to address 512k of memory. In addition this
  cleans up memory accesses since we no longer need to multiple every address by 2 to get the correct word access.
2. This patch does a proper implementation of the GCHRD command using the ead/dad/mask as specified via the datasheet. This is
  ncessary since the previous implementation did not use the mask properly which was preventing the screen clearing routines on the
  QX-10 from working properly.
Tests ran:
QX-10: diag disk in color mode. (Works)
compis: bildspel.cmd (Works)
dmv: demo5 and demo50 (Works)
pc-98:  adventureland, quarth, xevious, dbuster (Works)
rainbow: graphics diag disk (Works)
vt240 emulation (Works)
All tests ran the same as before these patches.

8381: epos.cpp: swap ceiling/call elevator button assignments on beastf [scoomby]
Whilst looking at the game differences between Super Glob, The Glob and Beastie Feastie, I noticed that the ceiling (or energy)
  button / call elevator button assignments are swapped on Beastie Feastie when comparing with Super Glob and The Glob.  This small
  change swaps the button assignments to match Super Glob, The Glob and the Pac-Man conversion of Beastie Feastie (beastfp).  In
  addition, this change also matches the button arrangements shown on the control panel images that can be found online.

8389: lwriter.cpp: Invert the state of the SCC interrupt [jrmuizel]
This dramatically improves serial output speed, which I believe
was limping along off the timer interrupt. It also fixes serial output
on channel B as well as with the ROM for the original LaserWriter.
Further, it better matches the 0x60 that VIA_PCR is set to which has
CA1 latch/interrupt control set to "Negative active edge".

8392: smc91c96 updates ( apple2e, a2osx w/ lancegs) [ksherlock]
1. m_loopback_result needs to be a signed int so negative results remain negative.
2. FDSE bit was masked out
3. when Full Duplex Switched Ethernet is active, deferral and collision logic is not in effect
4. implement AUTO_RELEASE mode
The receive collision detection seems problematic to me.  If it were a real hardware on a real half-duplex network, the sender would
  detect the collision and resend, AIUI. Currently, the 91c9x discards the packet and it will never be resent.

8394: nes.xml: Removed fancybro multicart extract. [0kmg]
- CRC match of the game can be found in at least one multicart, mc_52gam. Extracted game crashes when reset since it tries to return
  to the multicart menu.

8395: nes.xml: Two redumps, two new dumps, one dump removed. [0kmg]
- Replaced smb10 and smario14 with cart redumps. Previous dumps were rom hacks to allow the games to work on ancient emulators.
  [NewRisingSun]
- Likewise removed rom hack smb11a. smb11 is the proper pirate MMC3-variant dump, so it is retained.
- Hooked up heromali to correct slot device. Works now.
- Hooked smb4 up to correct slot. Works now as well.
- Bonus: hooked magicblks up to a proper slot device. Fixes graphics.

  one for teh GCHRD command, makes the FIGD command behave as it would on a real upd7220. It also fixes up the inital values for
  FIGS which did not match what was specified in the datasheet.

8418: ksys573: Add new variants for Guitar Freaks and Guitar Freaks 2nd Mix [987123879113]
- Guitar Freaks Ver 1.01 (JAD/EAD/UAD/AAD) has been dumped and is now the parent ROM. Guitar Freaks (JAC/EAC/UAC/AAC) has been moved
  to be children of Ver 1.01.
- Guitar Freaks 2nd Mix (JAA/EAA/UAA/AAA/KAA) has been dumped and is now a child of Guitar Freaks 2nd Mix Ver 1.01 (GQ883 VER. JAD)
  due to it being an older revision. The game can now be played in English by playing the EAA/UAA/AAA/KAA region variants.
- Guitar Freaks 2nd Mix Ver 1.01 (GQ883 VER. JAD) stopped working when I added the memory card unit code a few months back. When the
  memory card unit is attached, the game will boot as Guitar Freaks 2nd Mix Link Kit 2 (GC929 VER. JBB), and without the memory card
  unit it boots as Guitar Freaks 2nd Mix Ver 1.01 (GQ883 VER. JAD) using the same CHD. The machine configurations have been modified
  to allow for both games to boot as intended.
- Guitar Freaks 2nd Mix Link Kit 2 (GC929 VER. JBB) has been added as its own entry. This uses the same CHD as the previous Guitar
  Freaks 2nd Mix Ver 1.01 (GQ883 VER. JAD).
- Guitar Freaks 2nd Mix Link Kit 1 (GE929 VER. JAA) has been added. Unlike the Link Kit 2 GC929 VER. JBB version, Link Kit 1 will
  only give an error if the memory card unit hardware is not attached, so there are no hidden variants here to worry about here.

8434: viper: Audio support + updated documentation, inputs/dipswitches, new and fixed nvrams [987123879113]
Audio is now working in all games that I could get booting far enough to test audio, so I've removed the `MACHINE_NO_SOUND` flag.
  The exact details of how audio should work are unknown to me but there's no dedicated audio chip on the PCB from my research. All
  games include their own software audio decoders and perform all mixing, volume, panning, etc through software into the two data
  buffers at 0xfff000 and 0xfff800. There does not seem to be attempts to communicate audio-related anything through registers.
I've also gone through every game on the Viper hardware and updated all documentation regarding their status and included any new
  inputs, dipswitches, or general information I could find. I've also included modified nvrams (marked `BAD_DUMP`) for games that
  previously did not have nvrams or did not have the correct nvrams for the specific game image, all of which have been initialized
  to a clean state using the in-game RTC initialization functionality. When possible I also added new regional variants that were
  bootable with the given image dumps.
Almost all of the games have varying degrees of unplayability due to unimplemented I/O devices but `ppp2nd` is fully playable now
  (with graphical glitches), with the most notable non-graphical issue being a crash when transitioning from the test menu to the
  title menu.

-Debugger-related feature removals and cleanup [AJR]
 * Remove the hotspot read tracker. This was never robustly implemented, but changes to the memory system made it much less useful,
    and the "speedup opportunities" which it aimed to determine are not very important from a current emulation standpoint.
 * Remove the CURSP/GENSP state symbol and the generic sp() getter. Stacking semantics vary too much between CPU architectures for
    this to be of much use. (A "SP" symbol has been added to a few CPU cores whose stack pointers were otherwise not being
    registered.)
 * Remove the cached pointer to device_state_interface and the state() fast accessor from device_t. Most users of
    device_state_interface either already had a pointer to the specific CPU device type or needed to check first for the presence of
    the interface.
 * Change the PC memory write tracker to use pcbase(), which works even when the instruction callback is masked out, instead of
    peeking at the PC history index.
 * Remove some obsolete watchpoint-related definitions from machine.h.

-divtlb.cpp: remove a crash caused by the modulus operator In the original code all values are signed integers, so m_dynindex would
 overflow and become negative, then the modulus of a negative value by a positive one would generate a negative result and finally
 the next array read would make the program crash. Also the maximum value plus one of m_dynindex is not generally a multiple of
 m_dynamic and this would cause a jump in the values of liveindex. [yz70s]
