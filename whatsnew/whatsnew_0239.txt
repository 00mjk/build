8801: zr107.cpp: Correct dip switch labels and behaviour for Transmission Type [scoomby]
Whilst looking at MT#08124, I noticed the labels for Transmission Type were back to front when comparing with what is shown under
  the Service Menu.  Although this dip switch doesn't appear to be used, this PR corrects this very minor issue.

8850: Apple softlist update for November 2021 [Firehawke]
This is probably too late, especially considering there may be questions in regards to the software list adjustments.
Thus I'm tagging @rb6502 and @cuavas for discussion.
If it's agreed upon before the end of this month's cycle, make sure to remove the last commit message from the combined merge as
  that doesn't need to go into whatsnew.

8855: [naomi.cpp] Add support for render mode 5. [DragonMinded]
This is a super simple "fix" that adds support for render mode 5 (ARGB0888). I tied the functionality to render mode 6 (ARGB8888) in
  order to get it to work instead of printing the error message per-pixel. Technically this is incorrect: ARGB0888 fills in the
  alpha value based on a preset value in a configuration register 0xA05F8048 (which is not implemented in MAME), while ARGB8888
  takes the alpha value from the written pixel itself. However, the implementation in MAME for all render modes does not set the
  alpha value in the resulting framebuffer meaning that ARGB0888 and ARGB8888 are functionally identical according to the current
  implementation. This doesn't matter in practice because of two reasons: 1) The alpha value is only useful when rendering if you
  compare against the chroma threshold in 0xA05F8044 (this defaults to 0 and MAME does not appear to implement support for it
  anyway), and 2) alpha writeback seems most useful when using the PowerVR to render to a texture, and 32-bit ARGB textures are not
  supported.
Either way, after this fix the render output from MAME matches hardware when I tested it
  (https://dragonminded.com/images/mamehw.jpg).

APB (Domark, alt) [C64 Ultimate Tape Archive V2.0]
The Flintstones (Grandslam) [C64 Ultimate Tape Archive V2.0]
Ghostbusters (Activision) [C64 Ultimate Tape Archive V2.0]
Green Beret (Imagine) [C64 Ultimate Tape Archive V2.0]
In response to MT#08138, I have tested and promoted gberet to working status and added a usage field that explains that the c1541
  slot device needs to removed prior to loading.
I have also tested all other entries marked as not working and found both flintstn and ghostbsta also work if the c1541 slot device
  is removed prior to loading.  These entries have been updated in the same manner as gberet.
I also found apba works regardless of whether the c1541 slot device is removed or not so this has also been promoted to working
  status.  In addition, whilst testing apba, I found that the game asks for Side 2 not Side B so I have corrected the side numbering
  for apb and apba.

- Also corrected Space Shadow mirroring. Now game properly blanks background every other frame.

8949: bus/nes_ctrl: Disentangled Famicom joypad 2 from expansion port code. [0kmg]
- Removed read_exp call from fcpad2. The FC expansion port is not tied to the relevant line at all.
- Replaced with read_bit2 in the control port interface for the same purpose.
- Separated JOYPAD inputs from MIC. The microphone shouldn't be mixed with button inputs' shift register.
machine/nes.cpp: Also removed read_exp calls on FC control ports. Other than the microphone on fcpad2 nothing used these (nor should
  they as the only line in common is $4017 bit 0, which in general is never used by the expansion port).

Master Crane (set 2) [Israel León (Retrolover), ClawGrip]

8956: bus/nes_ctrl: Work on Famicom joypads + more separation of EXP port. [0kmg]
- Enforced proper strobe behavior on joypads. Added helper function to controller interface for common pattern.
- Added proper expansion port version of joypad.
- Streamlined pachinko controller by making it an expansion joypad subclass. Moreover, ball launch lever now works correctly!
- Added missing battery-backed WRAM to Pachio-kun 5, game runs now.
- Simplified arcade stick a bit, now also a subclass of the expansion joypad.
- Rewrote Hori Twin and 4 Players adapters. The latter's 4P mode protocol now works. In theory this supports six players
  simultaneously, though all known games using it have duplicate controls for P1 and P2.
machine/nes.cpp: Removed hack that shifted bit 0 reads to support controller port joypads on expansion port. There shouldn't be any
  expansion port devices left that write to bit 0.

8957: microdar.cpp: Improve documentation for 'cfarwest' [clawgrip]

8960: ctk551: implement sound, promote to working [devinacker]
Casio GT913 now has working audio, as well as a couple of CPU-related fixes. It's currently flagged as imperfect, mostly because I
  ended up having to fudge volume envelopes a bit until I (or someone else) can dump one of the models that features patch editing.
CTK-551 is now marked as working, but with `MACHINE_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS` since it still needs the graphical portion of the LCD.
  @galibert already made a nice SVG of the display (thanks again!), it just needs to be hooked up to the LCD controller at some
  point. The machine is otherwise usable as-is, though.

8962: vsnes.cpp: Fixed Balloon Fight bonus life DIP settings (MT8147). [0kmg]

8964: cinemat.cpp: Fixed inputs for Space Wars/Space Ship (MT8148). [0kmg]

8988: ymfm: Correct for free-running timer B multipler [aaronsgiles]
This is an experimental fix to see how it impacts the Konami games, whose music runs too slow. May impact MT08146, MT07078, MT03737.
I'm holding off putting it into mainline ymfm until I get confirmation that this produces the right result in MAME. The music is
  certainly a bit faster in contra at least, so it is having an effect.

9006: Fix chdman threading on cpus with many cores [tellowkrinkle]
- Defaults chdman to all threads on the system (previously used a maximum of 4 threads)
- Fixes a race condition that made chdman's rapid task allocation not properly wake up all threads (a thread wouldn't mark itself as
  active until it started running, so if two tasks were scheduled in quick succession, the first would notify a thread, and the
  second would see that that thread wasn't active yet (since it was notified but not yet running) and notify the *same* thread
  instead of a new one).
Side note: `osd_event` feels very easy to misuse.  In particular, the way it prevents inclusion of other checks under its lock makes
  me worry about anything that attempts to combine it with other flags to conditionally call `set()`.  In addition to the old wake
  code, `osd_work_queue::doneevent` does this with `osd_work_queue::waiting`.  I would recommend considering using a
  `std::unique_lock` like `std::condition_variable`, which makes it easy to extend the locking period to cover other flags, or maybe
  drop `osd_event` entirely in favor of directly using `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable`

9018: ibm5150/5170.xml: add some copy-protected images [rzero9]
These images were collected from various people that uploaded their raw flux dumps to the Internet Archive, so I have credited them
  individually.
A couple of notes:
- Italy '90 isn't copy-protected, strictly speaking, but it was distributed on a 80-track disk with only the first 40 formatted. The
  MFM image matches the first 40 tracks of the old one byte-for-byte, so there are no functional changes, but it represents the
  actual layout of the disk better.
- The "not working" games have been tested on an actual DOS PC with the HxC floppy emulator and the same images, and they work, so
  I'm fairly confident that the issues are related to the emulation.

9019: midiin_device: handle channel remapping at playback time instead of load time [devinacker]
feed1e143cbf088065df49d55454f1b21ef090ca unintentionally introduced a problem where trying to load a MIDI file from the command line
  would attempt to read the config port before the machine was running. This reworks it a bit to wait and modify the MIDI status
  bytes during playback instead of when initially loading/parsing the file.
I also fixed a parsing issue where the opening byte of sysex events was getting lost.

This set was delayed briefly when it was discovered a number of 3.5" 800K sets had incorrect compatibility information in the

  information to users about whether these disks work with the Apple IIe+.
As such, this PR corrects the disks that need correcting and adds the rest of this month's set.

9039: expand buffer size from 15 to 16 for %t time in video_manager::open_next [goldnchild]
One thing I just noticed:
the %t time format code from video_manager::open_next
it needs to be "char t_str[16];"  to accommodate the format string since it's 4+2+2+1+2+2+2+1 (terminating zero) for 16 chars.
If it doesn't have enough room for the zero it will drop the last specifier:
char t_str[15]; and a -snapname "%g/%t" will give filenames like: 
20211225_0406.png
char t_str[16]; and a -snapname "%g/%t" will give filenames like: 
20211225_042939.png
```
      if (pos_time != -1)
        {
                char t_str[16];
                const std::time_t cur_time = std::time(nullptr);
                strftime(t_str, sizeof(t_str), "%Y%m%d_%H%M%S", std::localtime(&cur_time));

-In response to MT#08138, I have tested and promoted gberet to working status and added a usage field that explains that the c1541
 slot device needs to removed prior to loading. [Steven Coomber]
 * I have also tested all other entries marked as not working and found both flintstn and ghostbsta also work if the c1541 slot
    device is removed prior to loading.  These entries have been updated in the same manner as gberet.
 * I also found apba also works regardless of whether the c1541 slot device is removed or not so this has also been promoted to
    working status.  In addition, whilst testing apba, I found that the game asks for Side 2 not Side B so I have corrected the side
    numbering for apb and apba.

-Moved localised I/O port name lookup into I/O port manager. [Vas Crabb]
 * Added pseudo format specifiers to controller port names: %p for player and %% for literal percent symbol.  This lets you get the
    localised player identifier in overridden input names (see NES and Neo-Geo for examples), and reduces the number of messages to
    translate.
 * For translators, the new messages are mostly previously existing messages with wording adjusted for clarity (e.g. referring to
    "media" rather than "ROMs" in several places, as things like disk and tape images are included).  It's also possible to localise
    the "???" dipslayed for an input without a valid name, but that should never actually appear in practice.

 * Replaced with read_bit2 in the control port interface for the same purpose.
 * Separated JOYPAD inputs from MIC. The microphone shouldn't be mixed with button inputs' shift register.
   - machine/nes.cpp: Also removed read_exp calls on FC control ports. Other than the microphone on fcpad2 nothing used these (nor
      should they as the only line in common is $4017 bit 0, which in general is never used by the expansion port).
