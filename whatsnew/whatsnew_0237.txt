8300: Optimized the multithreading strategy for -listxml [npwoods]
The previous algorithm would spawn tasks but wait for them in sequential order.  This is not necessarily optimal, and with these
  changes we will respond to which ever task may complete first.
On my computer (Quad Core 2), this triples the speed of a full -listxml

8482: softlist.cpp: Add support for a 'notes' field to store information about a software list or software list item.  [Wilbert Pol]
  [wilbertpol]
There is quite a lot of information regarding software for a system, why/how a software list item is broken, or how to use a
  software list item in the current software lists. Yet this information is only available in xml comments.
By moving this information into a xml tag the information becomes available for a frontend/ui and could be presented to the user.
Having the information in a tag will also allow us to change from xml to a different format without losing any information if we
  ever want to do so.
As an example I changed the wswan software list as part of this PR.

A number of Apple II cleanly cracked disks were re-cracked due to a
compatibility issue with IWM disk controllers on Apple IIc/IIgs
machines; while MAME was not affected by this issue, these sets are
being treated as promoted to working as real hardware still exists to
use these disk images. Several sets were not already in this software
list and were added above in the new additions left. As for the repaired
clean cracks, these sets are listed immediately:

8541: Initial RPK support for CoCo [npwoods]
Now that the RPK code has been decoupled from TI-99, this PR is an initial cut for RPK support for the CoCo.  For the basics of RPK,
  see https://www.ninerpedia.org/wiki/MESS_cartridge_handling
Currently I've only defined two `pcb_types`:
* `standard` - straight ROM dump
* `paged16k` - what it looks like
I'd like to see this as a starting point for a conversation about how RPK should work on the CoCo.  Possible directions:
* More PCB Types (for floppy controllers, Orch-90 etc) - since the implementations already exist for software lists, really all that
  needs to happen is for these to be named
* Multiple chips per RPK socket (@mizapf cited this as something that he liked about software lists)

8570: New machine marked as NOT_WORKING [devinacker]
----------------------------------
Casio CTK-551 [Devin Acker]
This is a new driver for the Casio CTK-551 keyboard, which runs on a custom H8/300-based CPU.
The main "not working" part at this point is the sound; I've figured out most of the register behavior but not the actual sample
  format. The LCD will also need to be turned into a SVG at some point, but right now it's just emulated as a regular 2-line LCD
  instead for testing purposes.
(I also made some small additions to `h8_device`, i.e. adding `AS_OPCODES` support and a missing jump instruction)

8582: bus/nes: Added emulation for A Winner is You homebrew cart. [0kmg]
- Enabled support for NES 2.0 PRG chunks >= 64MB and CHR chunks >= 32MB.

Note: I've not added the common ROMs (on the main PCB) as a ROM_SYSTEM_BIOS because I don't know if it can be considered as a BIOS.
  We found three PCBs and two different game carts, two of them with the same ROM as the one already on MAME ('tmspoker'), and the
  third one with the ROM damaged and unreadable.

8626: pc6001.cpp: Major rework of PC-6001mk2SR [angelosa]
* Added a PC-6001 cartridge software list XML, and hooked up to the driver;
* Fixed a regression bug with machine_reset fn where PC-6001mkII was implicitly overriding its memory model when a cart was
  inserted, causing being stuck at POST;
* Improved irq handling and removed a couple kludges, fixing hangs caused by multiple irqs being fired at the same time;
* Added PC-6601SR "Mr. PC", and improved the specific SR video mode already used by PC-6001mk2SR;
* Refactored PC-6001mkIISR / PC-6601SR memory model to use address_map_device, allowing BIOS booting and .cas loading in mode 6.
  Replace AY8910 with YM2203;
* Add keyboard inputs F1-F10, and fixed the specific irq vector dispatch;
* Add preliminary FDC internal/external interface. Hooked up PC80S31 to external i/f as a proof of concept;
* Fixed timer enable (fixes Yakyukyo and Punchball Mario boots), and fixed different timer resolution with PC-6001mk2SR so that
  cursor blinking happens at the right frequency;

As per MT#08093, the 2 off unknown dip switches adjusts the required number of rabbits that need to be captured to 4, 5, 6 or 8.

8630: debugger: Extended target address syntax to include device/address space. [cuavas]
(First of all, thanks to @yz70s for suggesting this approach.  This caters for the main use cases
  f4213dc209ebf2247f3c7e46f32d9bd2711bb374 was supposed to address.)
This extends the syntax of multiple debugger commands to allow the target address to be followed by an optional colon and a device
  identifier (tag or legacy “CPU index”) to allow the device to be specified explicitly.  As far as I can tell, this syntax
  extension won’t break any use cases.
This simplifies using commands like `dump` because you no longer need to supply all the other optional arguments if you want to
  specify a device.
The unsuffixed versions of most of these commands will now take the first populated space for a device irrespective of its index.
  This makes it easier to do stuff like dumping the address space for a random device when you don’t know if it uses `AS_PROGRAM`,
  `AS_DATA`, or some other random value.
Ideally, we should also add syntax for optionally specifying a space by its tag-like identifier.  That would allow dumping or
  setting watchpoints on the additional address spaces used by the 4004 and 4040 for example.  I couldn’t think of a harmless
  delimiter for this at the moment.  I’m open to suggestions.  Ideally the delimiter should be something that isn’t important in
  expressions to avoid forcing parentheses when you just want to add an address space qualifier.  When we do finalise this syntax,
  we can deprecate the suffixed versions of the commands.
The help text will need to be updated as a follow-up if this is merged.  I want to make sure no-one can think of a critical use case
  this breaks before merging it and spending time updating the help.
Examples of new possibilities:
```
wpiset 10:audiocpu,4,r
bpset 30fc:1

8660: st2205u.cpp - add some very preliminary ADPCM output [DavidHaywood]

8661: util: Further API cleanups [cuavas]
* Turned `core_file` into an implementation of `random_read_write`.
* Turned PNG errors into a standard error category.
* Added a helper for generating what look like derived classes on-the-fly.
The character I/O features haven’t been moved out of `core_file` yet.  There’s plenty wrong with them:
* Writing always uses UTF-8 encoding irrespective of what the detected encoding for reading is.  It’s not safe to use the character
  reading and writing features unless you truncate the file and completely rewrite it, then seek to the beginning before doing any
  subsequent reads.  This is not intuitive behaviour.
* If a file doesn’t begin with a recognised encoding of a U+FEFF character, or if you seek away from the beginning of the file
  before reading, `osd_uchar_from_osdchar` is used to convert characters in the file encoding to UTF-8.  On Windows, this uses some
  heuristic to guess the encoding.  The trouble is, it does this on a four-byte chunk *for every character read*, so it can guess
  different encodings for different characters.  This is crippling with Chinese locales in particular, because it’s overly eager to
  interpret sequences of ASCII English characters (which are a subset of UTF-8 and GB-2312) as UTF-16, producing mojibake.
* There’s no proper way to detect or recover from errors (the C standard I/O libray has `ferror` for this, and C++ I/O streams have
  `failbit`/`badbit`).
* The `eof` member function doesn’t behave like `feof`, creating a confusing situation for developers.  The standard `feof` function
  (and the equivalent I/O stream functionality) return whether a read stopped short due to encountering the end of the file;
  `core_file::eof` returns whether the current position is equal to the length of the file (it isn’t even necessarily accurate given
  the way the file length is cached).
* UCS-4 and UTF-16 modes interact poorly when the underlying object is socket-like.  If a read returns a “would block” error part
  way through a coding unit, the partial coding unit is lost and the `core_file` gets out of sync with the coding units in the
  underlying object.
* There’s no protection against seeking into the middle of a character.
There are still the issues with `core_file` assuming underlying objects always support seeking, which cause data loss when the
  underlying object is socket-like, the lack of write caching, and other implementation issues.
The `device_image_interface` member functions for reading or writing the associated file are poorly designed and should be
  considered deprecated.  Issues include:
* Errors are swallowed.
* The `fgets` function is based on the character I/O features of `core_file`, and hence inherits their issues.
* The result of `getch` is `\0` for end-of-file, read error, or an actual zero byte in the file.  It’s too ambiguous.  It’s based on
  unformatted read operations, so results of using it in combination with `fgets` are not intuitive.
Most code is updated in a way that minimises impact.  If it was easy to add error checking, it was added, otherwise I just added
  TODO or FIXME comments.
The PNG writing code takes a `random_write` rather than a `write_stream` because it seeks backwards to fill in the chunk length for
  compressed chunks.  With some creativity, it could be made to compress into a dynamic buffer in memory if supplied with a
  `write_stream` rather than a `random_write`.
The Microsoft DIB loading code takes `random_read` rather than `read_stream` because it seeks forward over unused data.  With some
  creativity, it could be made to read and discard data rather than seeking if supplied with a `read_stream`.
Microsoft DIB errors are still their own `enum` type.  They have considerable overlap with PNG errors, but then PNG errors have
  considerable overlap with archive errors.  Perhaps it would be better to merge them for the most part.  (Common conditions include
  bad file signature, corrupt file, truncated file, file uses unsupported feature, and decompression error.)
The dynamic derived class helper is one of the prerequisites for possible performance-enhancing features.

8674: Overdue internal UI enhancements [cuavas]
This addresses a number of shortcomings of the internal UI:
* Added support for message contexts and cleaned up the message catalog lookup code.  This required an update to msgfmt.py, which
  means Python 3.2 or later is now a requirement for building MAME.  This will likely only affect Mac users, everyone else has had
  Python 3 for years now.
* Made the internal UI capable of showing all software item `info` elements, with localised titles for some of the common ones.
  Also made searching the software selection menu search alternate titles, and added filters for some of the common `info` elements.
* Added a cache for software list contents for the last few machines selected.  This means if you select a machine to look at the
  available software, drop back to the main menu, then select the machine again, it won’t have to reload the software lists (unless
  you look at the software for several other machines first).
* Added support for loading localised system names from an external file (#8641).  This is only used by the system selection menu –
  other parts of MAME still use the built-in names.
* Made more path/folder options configurable through the internal UI.  In particular, the plugin and plugin data paths are now
  visible in the internal UI.  Also cleaned up the wording for a number of the path options.
* Changed the software list structures to use more appropriate containers, so O(n) walks can be avoided more often.
* Updated utf8proc to v2.6.1, which contains a number of fixes.
There are some limitations with favourites selection menus.  When viewing favourites, `info` element data is not displayed, and
  localised system names are not used.  Changing this is not practical at the moment.
At this point, only the tab-delimited localised system names format is supported (use UTF-8 or UTF-16 with an encoded U+FEFF
  marker).  Use a filename ending in `.lst` and put the file in one of the “DAT file” directories.  Localised system names is a UI
  setting, so it’s saved automatically in ui.ini.

8679: lx810l: fixes rightward walking carriage on mame soft reset and minor typo [goldnchild]
When hitting mame's soft reset (f3), the lx810l/ap2000 will walk the carriage's left most point to the location where the printhead
  is currently located.  This happens because the home sensor is looking at the stepper's position from get_absolute_position.  Upon
  reset, it resets itself to zero.  The printhead's position is stored in m_real_cr_pos and it tracks deltas of the absolute
  position.
Changing the home position sensor to look at m_real_cr_pos fixes this.  Previously, every soft reset walks the carriage leftmost
  home position to the right.
Also changed Espon -> Epson.

8691: Add preliminary Sun4/25 support [friedkiwi]
I've succesfully dumped the boot ROM of my SPARCstation ELC and added preliminary support for it to MAME based on the  existing Sun4
  work.
This patch manages to get the ELC emulation to get to the Open Firmware prompt, but booting any OS media (eg  Solaris/SunOS/NetBSD)
  results in an illegal instruction error on the OF prompt.
The emulation passes the boot diagnostics:

based on Phil. B discovering that Dragon Gun uses Namco Sprite customs.

8739: Adjusted MAME's crosshair to match shootgal's actual crosshair [aequites7]
Shooting Gallery (shootgal)'s default PORT_CROSSHAIR values are reverse and unscaled against the game's screen resolution.
The game does not offer a calibration option, but the test mode that comes up after a few seconds upon setting the DIP switch shows
  the internal crosshair for adjusting the gun.
The new offsets are manually determined. They are visual cues for the MAME users only and are unrelated to the game's operation.

-debugger: Extended target address syntax to include device/address space. (#8630) [Vas Crabb]
 * Added a validity check to ensure address space names are tag-like and unique, since they're now used as identifiers in debugger
    commands.
 * Extended the syntax for target addresses to allow them to be qualified with a colon followed by an optional device tag and/or
    address space name.  If only the device needs to be specified, a debugger CPU number may also be used.  This makes commands like
    bpset and wpset more flexible, as they can operate on CPUs other than the currently visible CPU.  Commands like find, fill, dump
    and load are more flexible as they can access any space of any device.
 * Removed now-redundant CPU parameters from many commands, and renamed pcatmemp to pcatmem for consistency with other commands.
    Extended region syntax for saver/loadr to support tags relative to the visible CPU (e.g. you can use "." for the region with the
    same name as the visible CPU, or "^sibling" syntax).  Added an optional root device parameter to memdump.  Changed
    interpretation of Boolean values to support numeric expressions as well as true/false strings and literal 1/0.
 * Added checks that the specified device is CPU-like to various commands that require a CPU (e.g. focus).  Previously these
    commands would crash or trigger an assertion failure if a tag for a non-CPU devices was specified.
 * Fixed the cpunum symbol so it uses the same rules for determining what is or isn't a CPU as parameter parsing.
 * Made device_t sanitise subtags better.  Previously you could cause an assertion failure or crash MAME by giving it unexpected
    relative tags via Lua or the debugger.
 * Added help topic alias support, and reworked the data structures to improve the performance of looking up debugger commands and
    help topics.  Removed the "ref" parameter from debugger command functions (std::bind can hold extra argument values for you if
    you need them).  Also added an error message if duplicate debugger commands are registered.
 * Updated help for commands that changed syntax, and also updated summaries for some commands that had changed in the past without
    corresponding help updates.

-Overdue internal UI enhancements (#8674) [Vas Crabb]
 * frontend: Added support for message context to localisations.
 * frontend: Added string_view versions of the message lookup functions.
 * frontend: Added a few more folder options to the internal UI.

-m88000d: Clean up over/out flagging [AJR]

-snes.xml: Change "Prototype" and "Alt" to lowercase. (#8685) [ArcadeShadow]
 * Changed various descriptive and disambiguation text to lowercase.

-frontend: Recovered precious vertical space for system/software names! [Vas Crabb]
 * Reduced the height of the bottom info panel by one line.  The system shortname or list/software name tuple are now only displayed
    in the info box on the right.  It's a bit out-of-the-way, but it's not something you need to see all the time.
 * The main reason for having the quit or return to previous menu item always visible is to make it easy for someone to quit if they
    only have a mouse.  However, we don't need waste space on the menu for this when we have a toolbar.  Users without a mouse can
    exit using the keyboard/controller UI Cancel input (given how important this is, it's unlikely they won't have it mapped to
    something usable).
 * There's now a toolbar button on the extreme right for returning to the previous menu or quitting.  The tooltip and icon are
    appropriately context-sensitive.  This recovers one line on the system selection menu, and two on the software selection menu
    since the separator is no longer needed.
 * Replaced the toolbar icons bitmaps with SVGs.  Colours/shapes may be tweaked before the release if people have good suggestions
 * Flipped the simple system selection menu so the description is on the left.
 * Moved the handling of special cases for the final menu item out of the base menu class.  It's still hacky having it handled there
    at all, but it's less hacky without if menus that want to do something different can do it themselves.

-RM Nimbus updates: (#8684) [prime6809]
 * Updated mouse handling so it mostly works
 * Updated SASI/SCSI code so that formatting disks with HDFORM works for ST125N and ST225N.
 * Added documentation of the video code drawn from the Nimbus Service manual.

New working software list additions (nes.xml)
---------------------------------------------
Super RPG 5 in 1 (CH501) [NewRisingSun]

-frontend: Keep cleaning up. [Vas Crabb]
 * Got rid of one of the UI audit inputs.  There only needs to be one, and the options can be presented in the confirmation menu.
    Two secret keystrokes is too confusing.  Also got rid of the long-obsolete UI Toggle Debugger input.
 * Added audit media button to the toolbar so it's a bit less opaque, and it can be accessed with a mouse/trackball (not just by
    knowing the key mapping).
 * Made default I/O port names localisable.
 * Made autofire plugin save port fields using the { port, mask, type } tuple, the same way MAME does.  Unfortunately this will
    break existing autofire configuration, but it should be more stable going forward.
 * Added some more UI keys to the default key mappings documentation.

-Updated Chinese translations. [YuiFAN]

-Re-generated translations for I/O port names. [Vas Crabb]
 * Trying to collect messages from everything at once hits some limit in xgettext and causes messages to be lost no, so I've split
    it up by the second-level source directories.
 * For some reason xgettext thinks overloaded Lua functions are blasphemy, so that has to be worked around, too.

-luna_68k: boots to monitor [Patrick Mackinlay]

-bus/nes: Improved support for various VRC clone boards. (#8687) [0kmg]
 * Expanded VRC4 CHR bank regs to 9-bit. This functionality is verified on Konami VRC4 hardware as well but is only used by clones
    (World Hero here).
 * Removed board for World Hero. Its VRC4 clone chip is under a glop top but is thought to be identical to Konami's.
 * Reimplemented TF1201 (Lethal Weapon) as a VRC4 subclass. Its clone chip is only known to differ by the IRQ reload bit, which it
    ignores.
 * Reimplemented Shui Guan Pipe as a VRC4 subclass. Its clone chip has different PRG banking but is otherwise standard.

-lckydraw, lckydrawa: made working in the electronic sense. [Robbbert]

-More UI enhancements/cleanup: [Vas Crabb]
 * Made the headings in the info viewer clickable, so you can switch between DATs with a mouse or trackball (or maybe a lightgun if
    that's your thing).
 * Made the UI red/yellow/green traffic light status colours less dirty-looking.  The "yellow" is more of an amber-brown than a cat
    puke brown now, and red is brighter.  The contrast with white text is definitely fine for red and green, but it's reduced a bit
    for yellow. However there's a limit to how dark you can make a yellow or orange colour before it looks muddy.
 * Reduced the number of places the UI uses red for things that aren't errors.  The error colour should be used sparingly, for
    actual errors.
 * Improved the colour swatch display in the RGBA colour editor.  It now has black/white underlay so alpha effects are move obvious.
    Also fixed a bug preventing the channels being run down to zero.
 * Fixed double-clicking configure machine causing MAME to exit from the system selection menu.  Also slightly adjusted the colours
    of the toolbar buttons again.

 * Started updating the documentation for the web site, and corrected some of the more misleading built-in debugger help.
 * Made some corrections to Chinese localisation after discussion with YuiFAN.
 * Darkened the UI red colour a little.

-Updated Greek Translation (#8694) [BraiNKilleRGR]

-lckydrawa: added note [Robbbert]

-More user experience improvements: [Vas Crabb]
 * frontend: Allow clicking the adjuster arrows on menu items.  This allows things like video options and DIP switches to be
    configured using a mouse only.  Also fixed a bug preventing paging menus with a mouse if the first item scrolled off the bottom
    is not selectable.
 * debugger: Allow wplist and bplist to accept a CPU argument to list breakpoints/watchpoints for a single CPU only.
 * debugger: Fixed some corner cases in address space syntax in memory accesses, and allowed memory region accesses to use tags
    relative to the visible CPU.
 * emu/softlist.cpp: Ignore notes elements when loading software lists. It's effectively a comment that isn't a comment
    syntactically, it's being used for things that are not useful to display in the internal UI, and it slows down startup.
 * docs: Updated three more pages of debugger documentation.  Also updated more of the built-in debugger help.
 * minimaws: Fixed up schema for software list notes, made sofware list notes display initially collapsed.

    (Clock Tower at least) in Akumajo Densetsu.

-bus/nes: Added a couple bootleg games using VRC2 clone hardware. (#8699) [0kmg]

 * dumped another PCB for TV Poker [f205v]
 * PCBs use a 4040 CPU
 * added NO_DUMPs to tv21_3 set
 * updated ROM labels

-More user experience improvements: [Vas Crabb]
 * frontend: Made it possible to cancel a media audit while it's in progress.  Also made the media audit multi-threaded so it's
    faster.
 * frontend: Made the DIP switches in the DIP switch preview clickable.
 * frontend: Made the system and software selection menus leave focus on the same system when clearing the search rather than
    jumping to the first item.  Also fixed a couple of bugs in the logic for keeping the selected item visible.
 * frontend: Fixed a few places that weren't showing localised system names.
 * frontend: Made UI Cancel clear a search in the file manager the same way it does on the system and sofware selection menus.
 * frontend: Made it possible for plugin menus to handle UI Cancel more naturally, backing up to the previous plugin menu rather
    than dropping straight back to the list of plugins.  Updated the autofire, cheat and cheatfind plugins, and fixed a few other
    issues in the cheatfind plugin.
 * debugger: Made the mount and unmount commands accept instance names as well as brief instance names.  Also updated another page
    of debugger documentation.

-frontend: Show full sofware name in right panel for favourites, too. [Vas Crabb]

-frontend: Two bug fixes. [Vas Crabb]
 * Audit menu was using one variable for two things, which obviously doesn't work.
 * DIP switch menu could trigger spurious clicks on for systems with too many DIP switch groups to show.
 * Also work around Xcode's issues with casting non-const to const reference wrappers.

-Actually commit the workaround for Xcode's issues with reference wrapper casts. [Vas Crabb]

-Fixed E7 cracks, some additional new apple2_flop_clcracked disks. (#8537) [Firehawke]
 * A number of Apple II cleanly cracked disks were re-cracked due to a compatibility issue with IWM disk controllers on Apple
    IIc/IIgs machines; while MAME was not affected by this issue, these sets are being treated as promoted to working as real
    hardware still exists to use these disk images.
 * Imperfect E7 cracks will not function on specific combinations of drives and newer Apple II machines due to subtle timing issues,
    but run fine on MAME and other emulators. Some, mostly Epyx, were not previously.

megadriv.xml: Mortal Kombat (prototype) [drx, The Hidden Palace]

-frontend: Cleaned up rendering of info views. [Vas Crabb]
 * Put the description for systems in the info box - it's useful for the fruit machines with very long names that are truncated in
    the list. Also stopped truncating manufactuer and parent name in the info box.
 * Made the text layout class capable of handling lines containing combinatations of left/centre/right-justified text and got rid of
    the legacy UI manager text wrapping function.  Made the system/software selection menus and the info viewer share the same code
    for formatting info text.  This means the multi-column layout works properly in the info viewer now, and the code is a lot
    simpler.  Also the system/software selection menus don't have to redo the text layout every frame now.
 * Made the info viewer update the text layout if the output aspect ratio changes, and cleaned up more legacy code.  The lines in
    the info viewer are no longer bogus "menu items", and there's a lot less special-case code to support it in the base menu class.
 * This commit includes an update to the Chinese translations from YuiFAN.

-Regenerate and patch up translation files for latest UI work. [Vas Crabb]

-frontend: Better code for carrying justification across when wrapping. [Vas Crabb]

-frontend: fixed horizontal offset on text boxes with blank lines. [Vas Crabb]

-frontend: Further improved behaviour of info box on system selection menu, and fixed alignment issues. [Vas Crabb]

-am9517a: Updates [AJR]

 * Revert previous change that corrupted DREQ input state when the mask register was written to
    (3b151130022e04fc6d4111fbf3aeec295e2659fb)
 * Add configuration methods to define initial state for DREQ inputs being active low (or high)
 * Add a few more internal helper functions
 * Disable side effects of reads for debugging

-marineb.cpp: Updates and fixes [AJR]
 * More accurate interrupt generation
 * Add watchdog timer

    flexible function for PRG banking and an overridable IRQ acknowledge function.
 * Added support for 830506C board.
 * Added support for unknown board for Yu Yu Hakusho/Dragon Ball Z 2-in-1.

Instituto Latinoamericano de la Comunicación Educativa / Secretaría de Educación Pública Micro-SEP 1600 [Tim Lindner]

-Still more user experience improvements: [Vas Crabb]
 * Changed the default mapping for UI select to not trigger on Alt+Enter fullscreen toggle.  (Fullscreen toggle still doesn't work
    in menus - actually fixing that is complicated.)
 * frontend: Made the about box wrap text properly, made the title and backtrack menu item always visible, and added a footer with
    the VCS revision.
 * frontend: Don't highlight the favourites and info toolbar buttons if there's no selection (can happen if filters produce no
    results).  Also made the info viewer appear even if no info is available - it's less confusing to see an empty menu than wonder
    why clicking the button does nothing.
 * debugger: Added a register points view to the GUI debuggers, to go with the breakpoints and watchpoints views.
 * debugger: Extended [brw]p(clear|(en|dis)able) commands to accept multiple arguments to perform the same action on multiple
    (break|watch|register)points at once.  Also made rplist accept a CPU for showing a single CPU's register points ([bw]plist
    already support this).
 * docs: Updated registerpoints debugger commands page, and updated other pages for latest extensions to syntax.

-Add new files to SDL OSD as well as Mac OSD. [Vas Crabb]

-Revert "Better rules for generating .po files - multiple jobs have an effect now." [Vas Crabb]
 * Need to find a better way of doing this without causing .po files to be rebuilt on every build.  The commit is still there for
    reference.

 * Updated cheat commands to work with arbitrary devices and address spaces.  You can still only search RAM areas in a single
    address space at a time, but any address space of any device can be used now.
 * Made the cheatinit/cheatrange commands not affect current state if the arguments are invalid.  Also fixed some bugs in the cheat
    commands.
 * Updated documentation for cheat commands, and added a simple worked example.  Also added single-sentence descriptions of what
    (break|watch|register)points are to the top of the relevant pages.

-frontend improvements: [Vas Crabb]
 * Added a bit more info to the about box, moved the VCS revision to the heading.
 * Don't show "not" codes in prompts - they're not helpful.

-Plugin usability improvements: [Vas Crabb]
 * autofire, inputmacro: Made left/right repeat when held (makes setting long delays/durations easier).
 * autofire, inputmacro: Added headings for devices in input selection menus (helps when controller buttons have identical names,
    e.g. AES)
 * autofire: Made intial selection when moving between menus intuitive, log some errors on saving/loading configuration.
 * autofire: Fixed two errors in Chinese localisations.

-Cleaned up CI targets: [Vas Crabb]
 * Restricted Linux CI build to only run on changes to code, translations, software lists, and build scripts.
 * Restricted Windows/macOS CO to only run on changes to code and build scripts.  They provide nothing over Linux for the other
    stuff.
 * Added plugin properties and controller file validation to the "hash" workflow.
 * Added a workflow for building documentation, so pull requests that affect documentation will at least get a basic check in
    advance.

-plugins/autofire: Bumped version as configuration format has changed. [Vas Crabb]

-Note that I have also added a reason why Cobra is not supported which was pointed out in PR#8689. [Steven Coomber]

-Filled in Japanese names for a bunch of inputs, fixed issues with localised P10 control names not showing. [Vas Crabb]

-shootgal: Adjusted MAME's crosshair to match actual crosshair (#8739) [aequites7]
 * Shooting Gallery (shootgal)'s default PORT_CROSSHAIR values are reverse and unscaled against the game's screen resolution.
 * The game does not offer a calibration option, but the test mode that comes up after a few seconds upon setting the DIP switch
    shows the internal crosshair for adjusting the gun.
 * The new offsets are manually determined. They are visual cues for the MAME users only and are unrelated to the game's operation.

    hasn't 8MHz or 48MHz XTAL), Fix naming speglsht.cpp: Fix 1 pixel gap in ST0016 layer srmp5.cpp: Reduce unnecessary line

-apple2gs: ROM 0/1 have the $C028 ROMSWITCH, support it. [R. Belmont]

-Plugin updates: [Vas Crabb]
 * Changed the hiscore plugin to save inside the "hiscore" folder in the plugin data directory.  The old hiscore path setting has
    already been removed from MAME for some time.  This means the plugin was always saving in the "hi" folder in the working
    directory with no way to change it, which is problematic on Linux and macOS, particularly for distro packagers.  There are lots
    of plugin and UI changes in this release, so we may as well get this out of the way now.  Also made it possible to change the
    "timed save" option from the Plugin Options menu, and save that in the data folder, too.
 * Documented the input macro plugin.  The only undocumented plugins now are the cheat plugin, the cheat finder plugin, and the port
    name plugin.

-srcclean in preparation for branching 0.237 release [Vas Crabb]

-Remove compiled message catalogs on clean, show clean commands for VERBOSE=1. [Vas Crabb]
