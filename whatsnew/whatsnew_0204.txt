 [DavidHaywood]

-v53: overhaul [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * An attempt to add the NEC V50 to the existing V53/V53A devices. Also overhauled for devcb3, and made some required changes to the
    peripherals. Because this is a pretty wide-ranging change, I thought I'd solicit feedback before merging it.
 * v53: refactor and add v50, devcb3, use templates and other general cleanup
 * am9517a: add 16 bit transfer support to v5x_dmau variant
 * i8251: minor tidy on v5x_scu variant
 * hng64: update to match v53 changes
 * mpc3000: update to match v53 changes

-i8008: I/O addressing is only 5 bits [AJR]

-mb87030: support padding mode [Sven Schnelle]
 * This makes Pascal 3.25 boot/run from SCSI on hp9k_3xx. Pascal is now a fully running OS like BASIC on these machines. While at it
    also clean up a few style issues.

-dsk_dsk.cpp: Avoid to use uninitialized booleans [AmatCoder]
 * Fix MameTesters #07134. Thanks to Klez for testing.

-segasp.cpp: add alternate network board 1.23 firmware, dumped and documented one more Bingo Galaxy satellite PCB [Darksoft]

-m52: improvements to alpha1v (promoted to working) (#4223) [David Haywood]
 * split alpha1v into different class etc.
 * fix sprite colours, looks like mpatrol could potentially support 3bpp anyway and the existing kludigng of the sprite clut prom
    was to save memory
 * mark it as working, I'm pretty sure 99% of the badness now is just the game

-XaviX - ignore unaligned palette select bits in bpp modes > 4 (ttv_lotr boot screen) (#4213) [David Haywood]
 * ignore unaligned palette select bits in bpp modes > 4

 * ekara now uses a Software List

-m68kmmu improvements (#4229) [dxl]
   - handle RW bit in ATC cache properly
   - add page table walk that result in BUSERROR to ATC
   - fix ptest instruction
   - trap if PLOAD is called with MMU disabled on MC68851
   - don't skip descriptor status update for page descriptors
   - set address in ptest to last descriptor address
   - add function code page table lookup
   - fix ptest level report in MMU SR
   - fix TT register matching (test RW bit, fix masking of bits)
   - decode fc field for pload instruction
   - fix decoding of pload instruction
 * m68kmmu: abort table search when WP is encountered
 * m68kmmu: various improvements
 * hp9k_3xx: call MMU buserror handler
 * m68kmmu: set M bit if root descriptor is of page type
 * It seems like at least the 68030 sets the M bit in the MMU SR if the root descriptor is of PAGE type, so do a logical and between
    RW and the root type.
 * m68kmmu: fix comment
 * m68kmmu: rename descriptor types to more useful names
 * m68kmmu: set type for 8 byte table descriptors
 * m68kmmu: use iterative approach for table walking
 * Otherwise we might return an arbitrary value if ptest can't find an entry. Shouldn't matter for the OS, but that change makes at
    least the compiler happy.

-hp9825: added internal expansion ROMs. Fixed authorship of hp9825.lay. [fulivi]

-new clones - U.N. Defense Force: Earth Joker (US / Japan, set 2) [Phil Bennett]
 * note, it's very close to the parent (71 differences in each ROM) but there are enough intentional changes (including a small
    block of 00/ff right before the data ends) that it can't be considered a direct replacement for the bad set; these aren't all
    single bit changes that could be attibuted to the bitrot.
 * also changed descriptions, as these sets aren't Japan only except for the prototype. also lowered sound levels so that they don't
    clip badly due to the MSM

-mu100: Make some noise [O. Galibert]
 * Two sample roms are missing, sad.  Volume is not taken into account yet (because the registers are not yet understood), pan is
    though. Don't even think about reverb or effects :-)
 * Current code plays a scale in a loop.  Comment the timer alloc in machine_reset to kill that.
 * Demo song (missing lots of sounds, because roms): U then > until demo then ENTER ENTER.

-hpc3: Improved DMA transfer behavior. The IRIX installer now loads, but panics. [Ryan Holtz]

 * replaced memory accessors
 * implemented tlb and address translation
 * corrected exception vector logic
 * improved cache isolation behaviour
 * comments/formatting

-debugger: add 'gp' command [Sven Schnelle]
 * gp 'go privilege' starts execution until the privilege mode changes. This can be used to break on task switches. I.e on m68k, one
    could do:
 * gp { ~sr & 0x2000 && crp_aptr == 0x1234567 }
 * which would execute until the privilege mode changes to user mode and the CPU root pointer is 0x1234567.
 * for cpu code, all that is needed to make this work is calling debugger_privilege_hook() when the execution level changes.

-m68000: show PMMU registers for 68020/030/040 in debugger [Sven Schnelle]

-mu100: Store some stuff, apply some filters [O. Galibert]

-hp9k_3xx: fix mem map for /360 [Sven Schnelle]

-hp9k_3xx: fix RTC corruption [Sven Schnelle]
 * pre-init the latch clock variable to 1, so the first write to the latch doesn't cause invalid data latched which would trigger an
    invalid write to the RTC, causing an invalid time.

-Woops... [Olivier Galibert]

-XaviX - improve inputs in e-kara, rad_rh (#4260) [David Haywood]

 * details of some of them to be filled in once I have cart scans, and in some cases a translation.  the e-kara web thing is
    probably useless these days as it was meant to work with PC software (there's an MCU + USB interface in the unit) to transfer
    downloaded songs etc. from a specific service into the cartridge for use on the system, and like many of these online services
    from 15+ years ago, the listed site no longer resolves.

-add Bare Knuckle III inputs, promoted to working. [MetalliC]

-add HP98550 high-res color graphic card [Sven Schnelle]
 * Used in the high end HP9000/300 machines. Provides a resolution of 1280x1024 @ 8bpp. It also provides two overlay planes and one
    phantom plane. Each plane contains two window movers that are used for copying characters and tiles on the screen. It also has a
    RUG for line/vector drawing. The current state implements everything that is required to have a working HP Visual user
    environment in MAME.
 * Working:
 * window mover
 * pixel replacement rules
 * window replacement rules
 * f0 tripple replacement rule (copy src or keep destination depending on pattern register)
 * VRAM bit access mode
 * solid line drawing
 * Not implemented yet:

 * So the following can be deduced:
 * Main board 837-6500-01 is standard 68000 + stardard Z80 Main board 837-6500-02 is standard 68000 + MC8123B (317-0054)

-XaviX - cheap hack to get epo_efdx to show a title screen + dumps of the remaining US e-kara carts hopefully this makes it easier
 for me to trace why the i2cmem hookup fails, and if it's due to code execution problems causing the unwanted writes, if the device
 should be less sensitive to them, or if there's an error in the driver hookup. [DavidHaywood]
 * still not entirely sure the game is happy with what it gets this way, but it's something to work with.

-Add HP98643 LANIC network card [hp9k]

-World Rally / Blomby Car improvements (shadow / headlight in Blomby Car) Blomby Car is a bootleg of World Rally, many things are
 similar, but not quite the same, including the sprites. [DavidHaywood]
 * Previous emulation of Blomby Car was missing the shadow and highlight effect entirely.  This was implemented on World Rally.
 * Bringing the video implementations closer together has allowed me to add this missing effect to Blomby Car.
 * Also looking at some reference material it seems the emulation of the shadow / highlight effect on World Rally was 'too good' in
    some cases, for example, looking at original hardware videos it looks very much like you're meant to see a car shaped shadow as
    your headlights pass through the starting arch.  This wasn't present on previous emulation which used 2 pass drawing, but is
    present with the single pass drawing and mixing.

-nereid: add overlay support Required for the upcoming HP 98550A support. [hp9k]

-debugger: add %c to logerror This is useful for catching putchar() like functions and printing the written value to error.log.
 [hp9k]
 * On hp9k_3xx, i'm using this with the HP 300 test software, to log test error messages that get printed on screen to error.log, so
    i have the message directly after the debug messages from my driver.
 * Example:
 * wpset 0xfffe36be,80,w,1,{ logerror "%c", wpdata; g }

-XaviX - Improve sprite positioning + 24 new ekara dumps bit of a kludge for now to keep the Taito Nostalgia logo correct (and a few
 other cases) where the upper bits have to be ignored.  There's no obvious switch, hopefully something will uncover the real way
 this gets enabled later [DavidHaywood]

-pc9801_86.cpp: fix PSG regression This change fixes a regression introduced with the MCFG removal (commit
 cc59e2123eaa5e6c5c71317d28b55f425bb6a333) that caused the PSG part of the YM2608 to sound extremely loud compared to the rest of

-hp9k_3xx: fix RTC corruption pre-init the latch clock variable to 1, so the first write to the latch doesn't cause invalid data
 latched which would trigger an invalid write to the RTC, causing an invalid time. [hp9k]

-hp9k_3xx: fix mem map for /360 [hp9k]

-debugger: add 'gp' command gp 'go privilege' starts execution until the privilege mode changes. This can be used to break on task
 switches. I.e on m68k, one could do: [hp9k]
 * gp { ~sr & 0x2000 && crp_aptr == 0x1234567 }
 * which would execute until the privilege mode changes to user mode and the CPU root pointer is 0x1234567.
 * for cpu code, all that is needed to make this work is calling debugger_privilege_hook() when the execution level changes.

-namcos2.cpp : Fix c123 video RAM mirroring issue This PR is fixes metlhawk intermission. [cam900]

-earthjkr (Earth Joker) appears to be a bad dump, mark it as such the bad code is a single bit wrong and causes the last stage in
 the game to make invalid ROM writes due to using A2 as a pointer instead of A0, and thus breaking the rowscroll on that stage.
 (noticed the bug while watching MAME roulette video) [DavidHaywood]
 * the prototype clone has correct code here, and works fine, so it seems very likely a case of bitrot on the parent set.  (the ROM
    check done by the game is useless)

-Added ROM version 4.02 from an 820-II and 5.00 from an 820-II 16/8 The 820-II driver is not working at the moment. The 5.00 ROM
 shows "ROM error". Both additions have the extra ROMs for the low profile keyboard. [rfka01]

-mb87030: support padding mode This makes Pascal 3.25 boot/run from SCSI on hp9k_3xx. Pascal is now a fully running OS like BASIC on
 these machines. While at it also clean up a few style issues. [hp9k]

-m52: improvements to alpha1v (promoted to working) It's meant to be a conversion, or at least was given to us that way, but it
 disagreed with certain things about the way the existing mpatorl driver worked.  I think some of these things were optimizations in
 the mpatrol driver to save memory back in the day. [DavidHaywood]
 * it's a Kyle Hodgetts abomination, so without reference material it's very difficult to work out how things should be, eg. the
    power orbs you collect are part of the text tilemap, which must scroll, but with the scroll offsets and sprite positioning we
    have they only collide with the very back of your huge ship,  I think this is correct however.
 * It seems to expect double height background images, which strongly suggests that moon patrol should have this too, and is simply
    not populating the lower half, hence the 'solid colour' pull-up.  I've modified the driver to support this.
 * The game also has 3bpp sprites instead of 2bpp, the existing Moon Patrol sprite CLUT decode looks like it's been kludged to work
    with 2bpp instead of 3bpp, strongly suggesting that the board supports 3bpp and Moon Patrol just didn't use it, again leaving
    areas unpopulated.  This has been adjusted, removing the kludge and treating Moon Patrol sprites as 3bpp with 2bpp used.
 * As part of driver cleanups this also splits the palette/gfx etc. into multiple decodes and splits the PROMs into multiple named
    regions rather than kludging them all into one (this made it easier to work out the above, and also makes it easier to see in
    the F4 viewer which palettes etc. belong to which elements)
 * Overall this makes it look somewhat more like a game, but as mentioned without reference material it's difficult to know how this
    should look / play.  I've marked it as working because I think most of the badness is just from the game.

-restore tilemap offset to tumblep and chinatwn they were lost when the driver was merged with supbtime (verified with hardware

-v53: overhaul An attempt to add the NEC V50 to the existing V53/V53A devices. Also overhauled for devcb3, and made some required
 changes to the peripherals. Because this is a pretty wide-ranging change, I'm soliciting feedback before merging. [pmackinlay]
 * v53: refactor and add v50, devcb3, exploit templates and other general cleanup
 * am9517a: add 16 bit transfer support to v5x_dmau variant
 * i8251: minor tidy on v5x_scu variant
 * hng64: update to match v53 changes
 * mpc3000: update to match v53 changes

-pbaction: hooked up Tecfri external pinball display on Pinball Action (working but missing some comms) display is hooked up and
 functions, although there seems to be some communication back to the maincpu from the sub that is incorrect (attempting to hook it
 up prevents flippers from working) [DavidHaywood]
 * also killed off an anonymous timer.

-luaengine: add description comments for emu.item() While testing, found out that read_range ignores offset/index, and that it
 returns char data only. Is any of that a bug? [vadosnaprimer]
 * Don't see an option to request a review, but these questions are mostly directed to @cracyc.

New working machines
--------------------
gbcolor: Pocket GT (Eur, Prototype?) [VampierMSX, Porchy, The Dumping Union]
bbc_rom: Over 600 new ROMs supported. [Nigel Barnes]
Centurion - Defender of Rome (Euro, Prototype, 19910528) [ArcadeShadow]
Climber (Nintendo Game & Watch) [algestam]
Climber (Nintendo Game & Watch) [algestam]
Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix [zino, ClawGrip, The Dumping Union, Recreativas.org]
Notes: [clawgrip]
The console has stereo output (via two RCA cables), but the driver outputs mono. [clawgrip]
I've marked the game as MACHINE_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS as every other game on the driver, [clawgrip]
but I see no graphical differences with the real game. [clawgrip]
I recorded a video of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmwcrRqufI [clawgrip]
The original console shows a "Konami" banner on startup, but it seems to be missing on the emulation. [clawgrip]
MAME crashes when the game is resetted (F3) on a MAME debug build. [clawgrip]
EC0003-  J-Pop Mix Volume 3 [DavidHaywood]

New working clones
------------------
Street Fighter II: The World Warrior (USA 910522, Rev. H) [Chris Gleed]
Touchmaster 4000 (v6.02 England) [Porchy, Brian Troha, The Dumping Union]
Xevious 3D/G (World, XV32/VER.A) [pacman70, Asayuki, smf]
I changed the other World set to VER.B, as there is a note in the driver that the board had that label. Someone may have forgotten
  to update test mode build text. The only difference I've found between the two sets is song 30 in test mode. [smf-]
Centipede (bootleg, set 2) [Joe Magiera, The Dumping Union]
Shin Ib Sa Won - Seok Dol I [gp-lee, Guru]
Snow Bros. 2 - With New Elves / Otenki Paradise (bootleg, set 2)  [xuserv]
X-Men: Children of the Atom (Asia 941219) [Brad Hicks]
Street Fighter II: The World Warrior (World 910204) [Brian Troha, The Dumping Union]
Battle Mania Daiginjou (Jpn, Prototype, 19910528) [ArcadeShadow]
Shinobi (set 5, System 16B) (unprotected) [Brian Troha]
Klax (Japan, version 4) [farzeno, The Dumping Union]
note, it's very close to the parent (71 differences in each ROM) but there are enough intentional changes (including a small block
  of 00/ff right before the data ends) that it can't be considered a direct replacement for the bad set; these aren't all single bit
  changes that could be attributed to the bitrot. [DavidHaywood]
also changed descriptions, as these sets aren't Japan only except for the prototype. [DavidHaywood]
also lowered sound levels so that they don't clip badly due to the MSM [DavidHaywood]
