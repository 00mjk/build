Translations added or modified

Source Changes
--------------
-Add AMD/Plessey 2812 FIFO device (for WIP Star Rider driver) [Vas Crabb]

-Add very preliminary Intel 82355 BMIC device [AJR]

-MT 07281 [Robbbert]

-rebound.cpp: Performance optimization. [couriersud]

-netlist: Add power terminals to most logic devices. [couriersud]
 * This fixes an over simplification. Logic devices implicitly assumed that GND/VDD actually is connected to GND(i.e. 0V). There is
    no immediate benefit from this change. It is a preparation for the future scalability. Now all power terminals (typically 7/14,
    8/16) have to be explicitly connected to the supply rails.
 * Also added a validation mode to the netlist core. This is not intended for running, but solely to better indentify pins which are
    not properly connected.

-netlist: bug fixes and nltool validation. [couriersud]
 * nltool now supports a validate command which acts similar to MAME's validation.

-netlist: use A,B,C,... for packaged components. [couriersud]

-tzx_cas.cpp: Apply 1ms pause only on data blocks [AmatCoder]
 * Fix MT #07296

-netlist: Add more validations and fix issues identified. [couriersud]

 * newport: Various fixes. [Ryan Holtz]
   - Added support for 4bpp RGB framebuffer display.
   - Added dithering support.
   - Fixed shaded rendering mode.

-Jack Potten's Poker (set 11, German, W.W.) improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Fixed inputs.
 * Added default NVRAM.
 * Added button-lamps support.
 * Promoted to working.

-Enable Xinput by default [Kiall Mac Innes]
 * On Linux, enable Xinput support by default. The Xinput lightgun driver is the only reliable+accurate method to use lightguns on
    Linux, we should enable this by default to reduce the friction for Linux Lightgun users. This should have no effect on users of
    Windows/Mac etc.

-Document Linux Lightguns with Xinput [Kiall Mac Innes]
 * Add a new doc page within the 'Advanced Configuration' section which describes how to enable Lighuns on Linux using the XInput
    lightgun provider.

-New working machine [braintro]

-New NOT_WORKING machine (#4915) [ClawGrip]
 * New NOT_WORKING machine
   - -------------------------- Cricket [@LosTrastosDeXaX, ClawGrip]

-netlist: runtime performance statistics on demand. [couriersud]
 * Runtime performance statistics can now be enabled with nltool option "-s". To enable those with MAME you need to run
 * NL_STATS=1 ./mamenl64 -v -oslog game

-MT06085: Fix "1" pixel issue mentioned. [couriersud]
 * Actually this is more of a "half" pixel issue and caused by discretization to pixels by drawing arbitrary length horizontal
    vectors onto a bitmap. The fix uses a 4x horizontal resolution and causes some 25% performance loss.

-dragon.cpp: Fixed cursor keys in Natural keyboard mode. [Nigel Barnes]

-sam6883: Mirror 32K RAM in 64K mode, prevents segfault when Dunjunz checks for 32/64K. [Nigel Barnes]

 * newport: Various changes. [Ryan Holtz]
   - Added several modes used by Metero Blast demo.
   - Added support for Scr2Scr Block transfers on planes other than RGB/CI. Fixes popup menus.
   - Added support for single-pixel line iteration.

-mario: Fix an error in the schematics. [Couriersud, Tafoid]
 * This became obvious after the improved LM3900 model was introduced. Thanks to Tafoid for indentifying the issue.

-netlist: Fix MT06827. [couriersud]
 * All pstonum calls now need to specify if they want local locale or the "classic" "C" locale.

-netlist/plib: Fix memory leak when exception is thrown in constructor. [couriersud]

 * newport: Added a few more command configs. Fixes SceneView, albeit with glitches. [Ryan Holtz]

-flkatck.cpp : Correct CPU type [cam900]

-tc0280grd.cpp : Updates Simplify handlers, Use shorter type values, Reduce unnecessary lines, Fix spacings [cam900]

-cromptons.cpp: added timekeeper dump for ffruits [SpinalFeyd, The Dumping Union]

-atarirle.cpp : Updates Simplify handlers, Use shorter type values, Fix spacing [cam900]

-cgenie: Fix MT06242 [Dirk Best]

-Bonanza's MiniBoy 7: Fixed button-lamps order. Removed log with implemented R/W. Lamps are temporarily disabled due to some sort of
 additional data that adds an unwanted and odd blinking effect. Maybe it's some kind of multiplexion. [Roberto Fresca]

-netlist: Protect defines with ifdefs ... [couriersud]
 * Protected defines in nl_config.h with ifdefs. Added a define to disable queue statistics during compile. This is only needed
    during development. Documented performance improvement efforts so I don't try this again.

-netlist: Fix the 7448 mess. [couriersud]
 * Moved truth table implementation of 7448 in macro. At the same time added power terminals and update game netlists accordingly.

-miniboy7: Fix lamp blinking [AJR]

-emu/tilemap.cpp : Simplify handlers [cam900]

-Miniboy7.cpp: Documented the way PIA port B lines 4-7 are multiplexed through a 74LS157 to read the 8 lines of DSW2 using the
 AY8910 port B line 7 as selector. Added ASCII diagram. [Roberto Fresca]

-miniboy7.cpp improvements... [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added support for Super Mini-Boy that runs in different HW revision.
 * Added technical and game notes.
 * Some clean-up.

-tutankham: Implement starfield, better colors. [Guru, Couriersud]
 * Used color code from galaxian for better color approximation. The starfield code was added to better document the 084 custom
    chip. There are two star fields implemented now. The active one can be selected in Machine Configuration.
 * a) Scramble Starfield
 * 1/3 star width like scramble/galaxian, starfield code same as scramble. This one is similar to the Konami starfield video below.
    The 084 uses the same signals as scramble.
 * b) Bootleg Starfield
 * Guru provided schematics of a daughter-board which on a Konami bootleg replaced the custom chip 084. This starfield matches the
    starfield (picture) of this bootleg. At least there is now a starfield which matches a real-life(tm) bootleg.
 * None of the two alterntives reproduces the star field which can be observed in the Stern videos on youtube.
 * The Konami video mentioned in video/tutankhm.cpp is different from tutankhm. Looks like we are missing an early board dump

-Autofire plugin: Save/load fixes This fixes a bug with saving/loading autofire settings, where soft-resetting the game would cause
 the settings to be lost due to their being reloaded from the settings file. [jackrjli]
 * This also fixes a crash that could happen by hard-resetting a game in the middle of editing/adding an autofire button. The menu
    state would not be cleaned up, and accessing the old ioport_field references would cause MAME to crash.
 * I also replaced the get_settings_path implementation that reads the plugins path option and concatenates "/autofire/cfg/" with
    one that implements "set_folder" to get the plugin's directory, because I just learned that that exists.

-k573dio/k573fpga: Full playability with all testable games This is the big one. I've tested every DDR game (except variants),
 Dancing Stage game, Drummania game, and misc stuff like Dance Maniax and Mambo a Gogo and they all seem to be working well now.
 Previously broken games should all be working now, including stuff like Dance Dance Revolution Solo Bass Mix and Dancing Stage
 featuring Disney's Rave. Someone will have to test Guitar Freaks still but the engines should be nearly identical to their
 Drummania counterpart. Playability is being defined as "can go through the menus and play multiple songs" for clarity. I went
 through and tested at least 2 songs in every game due to time constraints. [windyfairy]
 * ## Known issues
 * Martial Beat is still unknown because it has an I/O error at the beginning
 * Dance Maniax/Dance Freaks has a buzzing noise still. Someone looked into this and it seems to be the announcer audio, and using
    the Dancing Stage Euromix 2 BIOS removes the buzzing noise but the announcer still doesn't play it seems. Audio otherwise works.
 * Drummania 8th Mix has an issue with the Konami logo looping, but otherwise works.
 * ## Changes
 * I thought I had included the code for set_mp3_dynamic_base in the ksys573 driver, but I seem to have forgotten it before. This
    fixes GF11DM10 and GF10DM9. This is kind of a hack but I couldn't find a logic way to determine this information.
 * Remove set_buffer_speed hack. This data is now calculated after decrypting one frame of the encrypted MP3 stream. This should be
    more accurate and less hacky.
 * aa8_r should have been mpeg_key_1_r, and it *must* return the key assigned to it. This fixes Dance Dance Revolution Solo Bass
    Mix.
 * Added a new configurable define to k573fpga, SAMPLES_BUFFER, which controls how many samples must be read into the buffer before
    it'll start playing audio. This gives an intentional delay. The previous behavior was to start playing audio as soon as possible
    which does not seem to be the right way to do things (audio starts before transitions could finish, etc). It might be worth
    exposing this value in an ini somewhere if per-machine configurations are supported in MAME (I have no looked into if this is
    possible) as a way to let the community easily find an optimal setting. The current setting of 30 frames worth of samples
    (roughly) was calculated using the Konami logo sound in Drummania 10th Mix. This logo sound would start to loop before moving on
    to the title screen, which is not correct behavior. The current value allows playback of the sound just enough so that it plays
    in full and the game can stop the playback when it transitions into the title screen before it has a chance to loop. It may be
    placebo, but timing in games feels more correct after this change. I will try to figure out a more precise delay in the future
    by measuring the time it takes for the MAS3507D to start outputting audio after it starts receiving data packets.
 * Full MP3 streaming. I removed the hack from before that would check if an MP3 should have been fully loaded into memory or not,
    and instead just stream the entire thing as it progresses. This fixes (I think) Dancing Stage featuring Disney's Rave I believe.
 * Various bugfixes, refactoring, and cleanup

-Update k573dio/k573fpga to use a proper algorithm for decrypting ddrsbm audio + volume fix [windyfairy]
 * Volume fixed when the gain is set to 0 (should be muted but instead turned really loud)
 * Figured out a new algorithm for ddrsbm's music which does not rely on external precalculated data. This new algorithm has been
    verified to make sure it generates the same data used for the decryption key as before, but the data is instead generated
    directly from the crypto key that is sent to the FPGA. (Pinging @galibert because you showed interest in reversing this one in
    the last PR).
 * --
 * Another PR will be coming down later this week which fixes full MP3 streaming (no more hacks for streaming directly from memory),
    as well as fixes various bugs with other games. It'll be a rather big change in term of how things work so it will be a separate
    PR after it gets a thorough testing with as many games as possible.

 * This PR adds a new build flag to disable this hack by default, those who need it, can enable it.

-Partial support for encrypted audio in k573dio (Konami System 573 Digital I/O) This patch adds partial high level support for the
 FPGA and MP3 subboard in k573dio. [windyfairy]
 * ### MP3 decoder minimp3 was chosen for MP3 decoding because it was easy to integrate, easy to modify, and is licensed under CC0,
    which is compatible with GPL.
 * ### Compatibility All Dance Dance Revolution/Dancing Stage games except the Solo series (ddrs2k, ddrs2kj, ddrsbm) seem to be
    working based on my testing.
 * The Guitar Freaks/Drummania series also seems to work up until GF10DM9, at which point there are some playback issues in-game.
    The MPEG control flag must be set during the song previews, menu BGMs, etc, but if you set it during the actual song then it
    stops the chart from progressing. I can't find any way to differentiate the two scenarios.
 * Mambo a Gogo works.
 * Dance Maniax series *seemingly* works, but there seems to be an issue with the underlying PSX audio emulation which causes it to
    play a buzzing sound over top everything. This is in base MAME and not an issue with this PR.
 * Martial Beat is not possible to test due to an I/O error at boot.
 * Playback is rough in some areas. The MPEG control flag in particular seems to be quite temperamental, and getting that right is
    the key to making the currently broken games work. I've made a hardware test which I ran on the real Sytem 573 Digital I/O
    hardware, and during MP3 playback the MPEG control flag always returns 0x1000, and when it's not playing anything it returns
    0x0000, but properly emulating that behavior does not seem to fix things. There is possible some timing issues involved which
    seem to be beyond my capabilities and knowledge of how the hardware is managing it.
 * The audio decryption code for all games is working, and with some very hacky workarounds for the MPEG control flag it's possible
    to get the currently broken stuff working as well.
 * ### Assistance/advice requested
 * Anything involving the MPEG control flag. I think there may be 3 or 4 different versions of the FPGA firmware from what I could
    tell by looking at the game's data, so this may possibly be a result of different behavior between the FPGA firmwares.
 * The MP3 decoding loop. I'm not sure at what timing the game actually behinds decoding things, and I feel like my current
    implementation is just not very good but I'm not sure what to do about it.
 * Ideally the MAS3507D code would be used more often I think, since it's kinda just being worked around for now.
 * I'm iffy about modifying the samples device code like I am doing here. I'm especially iffy about the update callback which may
    have unintended performance implications in other areas. Is there a better way to do this?
 * I've made some modifications to minimp3 but I'd like to revisit this and try to make it work with a non-modified minimp3 in the
    future if possible, so it's easier to keep the library updated when needed.
 * Buffer speed workaround. It works perfectly fine from what I've tested, but I feel like this can be done better. It may have
    something to do with the bitrate of the MP3 or something along those lines.

-Add DS1994 device [grullosgo]

-Bally pinball: Fixed default dip switches from last commit. Added dip settings for more machines. [darren5]
 * In previous commit I inadvertently set the default dip switches for some games to all 0.  This has been fixed. Games with no
    specific Bally OS defined will default to the same as they did before.
 * Added/corrected dip switch settings common to all games that use OS version 35, 50, 52, and 53.

-Add plugin for autofire This is a plugin I wrote to provide autofire/turbo functionality in MAME. MAME already has a built-in
 autofire feature accessed through the cheats menu, but this implementation contains extra features/flexibility, including:
 [jackrjli]
 * Saving and loading autofire settings (saves a config file per rom so autofire settings will be remembered the next time you load
    the rom)
 * Separate buttons for autofire and non-autofire
 * Individual autofire rates per button (e.g. one button for 30 Hz autofire and another for 15 Hz). The number of frames to hold the
    button and the number of frames to release the button are individually customizable.
 * Note: One potential point of confusion is that the autofire keybindings are managed in the menu provided by the plugin, separate
    from the regular input menu. It's possible to assign an autofire button to the same key as its non-autofire equivalent, in which
    case holding the key will cause the non-autofire button to win out and you won't get autofire.

-MISP3 DRC: Fix tlbmiss in delay slot There were two issues with the current DRC tlb miss handling. 1) If the tlbmiss was an
 instruction in a delay slot at the top of a 4k page then the wrong page index would be calculated for the tlb lookup. 2) The
 tlbmiss causes multiple sequential interrupts.  The current implementation loses track due to the multiple interrupts that the
 instuction is in a delay slot. This causes the preceding branch jump to never be taken even if the branch condition is met.
 [tedgreen99]

 * In the current implementation the branch to 0x43c07c is never taken even though v0==0.
 * I believe this patch is correct for the first two exceptions (tlbload and tlbload_fill) in that it causes the PC to go back and
    re-evaluate the branch instruction.
 * I am not certain of the code starting at line 700.  It seems that this will cause a re-compile of the code starting at the branch
    instruction instead of a re-evaluation the branch instruction and then compile the delay slot.

-mvme162.cpp: NEW not working driver for the MVME162 series of VME boards, boots to prompt but that's it for now. I did most of the
 research a couple of years ago so now I just rebased it and added the latest roms from bitsavers. There are similarities to the
 mvme147 but this series is based on 68040 and has more ASIC:s. There are many many variants of the mvme162 alone so I want to keep
 them separated to not confuse even further. [JoakimLarsson]

-Fix OS-9 disk writing bug The JVC format would helpfully read OS-9 disk images by filling in the the geometry from LSN0. But when
 the format was written back out a JVC header would be added. This would corrupt the image when used with other OS-9 disk utilities.
 [tlindner]
 * This problem is solved by removing support for the OS-9 LSN0 in the JVC format. Then creating a new format that understands the
    various geometries of OS-9 disks used by the community.
 * Also I added correct sector interleave to the JVC format.

-WIP: Document Linux Lightguns with Xinput WORK IN PROGRESS [kiall]
 * Add a new doc page within the 'Advanced Configuration' section which describes how to enable Lighuns on Linux using the XInput
    lightgun provider.
 * Related PRs: https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/4913 https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/4698
    https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/4862 https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/4118

-Enable Xinput by default On Linux, enable Xinput support by default. The Xinput lightgun driver is the only reliable+accurate
 method to use lightguns on Linux, we should enable this by default to reduce the friction for Linux Lightgun users. This should
 have no effect on users of Windows/Mac etc. [kiall]
