-taitoair.cpp: dumped ainferno's Controller PCB ROM  [ShouTime, The Dumping Union]

-Fixed an options overhaul regression (#2530) [npwoods]
 * This crash (discovered by Wizz) had the following symptoms: 1.  Start MAME 2.  Choose "Configure Machine" 3.  Choose "Video
    Options" CRASH
 * This was the result of the options editor not having a fully formed list of options where it was expecting one.  The fix is to
    change the declaration of emu_options to one that have full OSD options (it is possible that SDLMAME needs something slightly
    different)
 * I created a osd_setup_osd_specific_emu_options(emu_options &) function that given an emu_options, will slap on system specific
    options.  I see this as only marginally less gross, and I have zero opinion on whether this should be changed to return an
    emu_options (rather than have a reference parameter), be a static method on emu_options, or what have you.

-Created a more flexible imgtool::datetime structure for use within Imgtool (#2263) [npwoods]
 * Created a more flexible imgtool::datetime structure for use within Imgtool
 * This is intended to replace most usage of time_t
 * Changing the granularity of imgtool_clock from 1ms to 100ns, as per Vas' suggestion
 * Created arbitrary_datetime in timeconv.h to facilitate interpretation of datetime info
 * I concluded that invoking std::mktime on manually assembled std::tm is bad, because it is indeterminate how the std::tm members
    may be "dominant".  This required that I go further in imgtool, and update a number of drivers and eliminate the parameter of
    imgtool::datetime that takes std::tm.

 * (next step, make it use a bus / cartridge device instead of protection and banking being hardcoded in driver)

-use slot device for gamate cartridge slot, do protection handling there (it's a mapper chip in the cartridge) protection handled
 etc. written from scratch based on notes from Kevtris and Peter [David Haywood]
 * banking in the slot system seems somewhat archaic compared to proper modern banking, but this is how all other drivers I saw
    using slot roms did it.

-FM Towns softlists: new missing lists, several additions I have completely revamped the missing lists with about 700 new entries. I
 romanized most of the titles pretty much on my own, but my Japanese isn't quite the best so I may have made some mistakes,
 especially in titles with wordplay or obscure words. A second look at the list would be appreciated. [rzero9]
 * The new lists are based on "FMTOWNS用市販ソフトウェアデータベース Ver.0.3" (http://fmtowns.a.la9.jp/db/sdb.html), which is probably the most
    complete list of commercial software for the FM Towns that exists out there.
 * Also, I have added several of my own dumps, both CD and floppy. See the commits for details.

-document that the 'oldsplus' set identifies as "Oriental Legend 2" when set to Korea The (undumped) protection device internal ARM
 roms provide the region. [DavidHaywood]
 * As this has no external ROM for the ARM we have no way to trojan it out.

-Gamate sound is 100% AY8910 compatible according to Kevtris and Peter Wilhelmsen, use the AY8910 core. there's really no need to
 have a partial reimplementation as GPL code sitting in the audio folder... [DavidHaywood]

-Kaypro: Added the Omni 4 Logic Analyzer Story and files here
 https://hackaday.io/project/20151-floppy-fun-backing-up-a-unique-kay-pro-disk The software runs, but obviously complains about the
 missing i/o board. [rfka01]

-Added Kaypro 16 ROM, manual and disk set are available on the internet (cf. Bannister & FTP) The Kaypro CGA character ROM still
 needs to be dumped, and the harddisk controller originally used in the Kaypro 16 (WD1002-HD0, connected from a mainboard port
 rather than an ISA card) is not emulated yet. The configuration presented here is essentially the Kaypro 16/2, a version without
 harddisk and with two 360K floppies. [rfka01]

-EuroPC: Added first and last known BIOS versions I never saw an earlier or later BIOS version mentioned for the original EuroPC in
 a discussion thread. The 2.04 (and also the 2.05 that is already in MAME) don't work for now because according to one site memory
 management has been changed afterwards. They just show a dash on the top left of the screen. [rfka01]

-fix CPS3/STV (we always use timers for SH2 DMA, and have done for years, just forgot to remove the #ifdef on this code when
 cleaning up) [DavidHaywood]

-psx.xml: Added 76 new dumps, replaced 2 bad dumps Based on the redump.org PSX dat from 2017-10-10, I've added 76 new dumps (mostly
 demos, cheat applications and Lightspan discs), replaced two bad dumps and renamed a couple of original images to keep them synced
 with their corresponding redump entries. [aeternal606]

-SH3 / SH4 recompiler, first pass. This is an SH3 recompiler / preliminary SH4 recompiler.  I would appreciate help with the issues
 listed below (including general cleanups) as I feel at this point I've taken this as far as I can go and am starting to feel burnt
 out with it, so if another team member can take it further that would help immensely. [DavidHaywood]
 * A lot of code has been saved by eliminating all the copy+paste between the sh2 and sh4 cores, they now share a common execution
    engine with the additions in SH3/4 supported using a derived class.  It should be possible to further split these as currently
    the SH3 still has the SH4 functions available (as it did in the original core) however that was not the scope of this initial
    set of changes.
 * The work done allows the SH3/4 cores to use the UML based recompiler.  All the common ops are shared with SH2, while the SH3/4
    specific ones, which are used relatively rarely in the code, are handled with cfunc callbacks like the maths operations on the
    SH2 were.
 * Everything I've tested works exactly the same as it did before when the DRC is turned off.
 * Fastram support etc. from the SH2 core has been implemented
 * The changes made currently works very well for the CaveSH3 (CV1K) driver where the DRC has been enabled.
 * For SH4 based drivers 'MCFG_CPU_FORCE_NO_DRC()' has been used in the individual drivers to turn off the DRC until some bugs are
    fixed.  Currently some Naomi games, such as Crazy Taxi and Capcom vs SNK will boot and run with the DRC if you remove this line
    and enable it and they have noticable performance benefits when using it, however the majority do not boot for reasons unknown.
    If you want to test the Naomi driver with the recompiler make sure to remove the MCFG_CPU_FORCE_NO_DRC() line.
 * Example performance
 * mame64 pinkswts -nodrc -bench 150 Average speed: 458.40% (149 seconds)
 * mame64 pinkswts -bench 150 Average speed: 1027.86% (149 seconds)
 * So speed is more than doubled for the Cave driver.
 * ISSUES:
 * General code tidy up still needed.  public, private, protected members etc. aren't fully verified, and as the sh2 / 4 cores had
    diverged slightly over time there were naming differences etc. for many things, leading to some inconsistency after merging,
    although I've tried to address the majority of these some things could definitely benefit from improved naming.  What belongs in
    each header is up for debate too, the previous core #included some .cpp files, which is never optimal, the new one doesn't, but
    maybe things should still be split up.
 * Doing the address masking when the opcodes are read in the frontend::describe function avoids the need to have extra AM_MIRROR
    ranges required in the individual memory maps (as the proper opcode fetch mirroring is handled internally) however it seems to
    stop the debugger from working, not sure how to fix that.
 * Something goes wrong with the majority of the SH4 based software, so until that's fixed the recompiler has to be disabled for
    those titles.

-dynax.cpp: (tenkai) fix credits lost after exiting the game. The game checks for the the string "A WARNING.IF YOU COPY OUR ITEMS,WE
 REVENGE BY ALL MEANS." at address 0x6E17, and will reset everything if the string does not match when the game starts.
 [CecilHarvey]
 * In the current implementation only 0x7000-0x7fff is saved as nvram after exiting the game, which will cause the string to be
    lost.
 * I'm not sure what the exact nvram address is, but at least this works.

-add apple2_cass tapes Trying to add more tapes. Passed checks first time. After changing feature name from "label" to "part_id" it
 failed a "Travis build" test with an error message about operators. Hopefully it will pass this time because all this is beyond my

-move sh2 / sh4 to a folder called superh the sh3 / sh4 core contains a lot of copy + pasted code from the sh2. [DavidHaywood]
 * the family name is SuperH, so it seems more logical to place them in a folder with that name.
 * the basic execution engine could be shared, the diassembler could be shared (most of it is a straight copy+paste at the moment)
 * sh3/4 add things like fpu ops, mmu, 64-bit data bus but it should otherwise be possible to refactor and rebuild them around the
    existing sh2 core.
 * longer term this should allow leverage of the sh2 recompiler with some modifications (most of the new FPU ops in sh3/sh3 could be
    implemented with the UML cfunc callbacks like some of the existing SH2 maths ops still are, until somebody writes UML
    implementations of them)
 * anyway, this just gets things in place for further refactoring, no actual code changes in this commit.

-Gaelco touchgo improvement - new SRAM dump verified using 2 more boards in order to weed out the bad bytes, image is now trusted
 and correct. [DavidHaywood]
 * also set androidp to 1987, the date is shown during the end credits.

-proteus3: added mc14411 bit rate generator device and replaced the timer based clocks for the ACIA:s [Edstrom]

-Terco 4426 programming station cart banking fixed Still some odd exits to a disabled BASIC prompt for last two main menu options.
 It is probably some memory map issue/main board modification not emulated yet. I will verify this on real hardware before hunting
 the cause of it. [Edstrom]
 * Good news is that it is now possible to write a small CNC program and send it to a printer, or even better, the Terco 4490 CNC
    which is on my to do list to emulate, so the cart is working to an extent.

-Added support for multiple PORT_CHAR() bindings, and adopted in the CoCo driver  (addresses MT#2618) [npwoods]

-z80sio/z80scc: now returns cpu specific default vector when no interrupt found to acknowledge. I failed to merge this correctly
 before for z80sio, it was merged but disabled. This is fixed now and also implemented this for z80scc. This fix should work for any
 CPU now, not only 68000 as previously. [Edstrom]

-Fixed an options overhaul regression This crash (discovered by Wizz) had the following symptoms: 1.  Start MAME 2.  Choose
 "Configure Machine" 3.  Choose "Video Options" CRASH [npwoods]
 * This was the result of the options editor not having a fully formed list of options where it was expecting one.  The fix is to
    change the declaration of emu_options to one that have full OSD options (it is possible that SDLMAME needs something slightly
    different)
 * Please scrutinize this fix.  I hate it.  I also hate how all of the OSD options are duplicatively declared in submenu.cpp, but
    with a different data structure.  At the very least we should be having some sort of factory to create "full" options for the
    pertinent platform; but I'm not sure how precisely we would want it to work.

-Created a more flexible imgtool::datetime structure for use within Imgtool This is intended to replace most usage of time_t
