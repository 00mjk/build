 * This reverts commit 6ec6ee3cb71d47571a750ce58a29e2222fff37d8.
 * Sorry, but re-adding the tag to the logging like this is not an improvement.  It adds clutter when using logerror as intended,
    with the debugger log window or with the -oslog option sending it to stderr.

-add lua translation to makefile and update translations [cracyc]

-abc800: Added skeleton for Databoard 4112-23 floppy disk controller. [Curt Coder]

-add apple2_cass tapes (#2698) [Dagarman]

-saturn.cpp: rewritten SMPC into a device [Angelo Salese]
 * (out-of-whatsnew: added remaining devices, removed almost all trampolines, cleanups, merge implementations between ST-V and
    Saturn)

-smpc.cpp: simulate SETTIME bit behaviour if an invalid NVRAM data is found for Sega Saturn like original HW does. [Angelo Salese]
 * Now all Sega Saturn romsets calls the BIOS setup if NVRAM is uninitialized. This is intended behaviour and sets up proper
    defaults like Japanese language for saturnjp set.

-dynax.cpp: fix credits lost after exiting the game. The game checks for the the string "A WARNING.IF YOU COPY OUR ITEMS,WE REVENGE
 BY ALL MEANS." at address 0x6E17, and will reset everything if the string does not match. I'm not sure what the exact nvram address
 is, but at least this works. [Wei Mingzhi]

-Note Chance: Added a lamps panel for debugging purposes. Also added notes about some inputs [Roberto Fresca]

-mc68901 : fix TCDCR register [Nicolas PLANEL]
 * bits 6-4 are used for timer C bits 2-0 are used for timer D

-taitoair.cpp: dumped ainferno's Controller PCB ROM  [ShouTime, The Dumping Union]

-am9513: Implement time-of-day mode [AJR]

-Fixed an options overhaul regression (#2530) [npwoods]
 * This crash (discovered by Wizz) had the following symptoms: 1.  Start MAME 2.  Choose "Configure Machine" 3.  Choose "Video
    Options" CRASH
 * This was the result of the options editor not having a fully formed list of options where it was expecting one.  The fix is to
    change the declaration of emu_options to one that have full OSD options (it is possible that SDLMAME needs something slightly
    different)
 * I created a osd_setup_osd_specific_emu_options(emu_options &) function that given an emu_options, will slap on system specific
    options.  I see this as only marginally less gross, and I have zero opinion on whether this should be changed to return an
    emu_options (rather than have a reference parameter), be a static method on emu_options, or what have you.

-Fix main interrupt flag. [Jean-François DEL NERO]

-Actually make sure OSD options are included when saving through UI [AJR]

-Note Chance: Found another input and documented the game behaviour. Added more notes. [Roberto Fresca]

-Note Chance: Documenting the second bank of samples... [Roberto Fresca]

-Note Chance: Documented the second bank of samples. [Roberto Fresca]

-Note Chance: OKI frequency and pin7 status match the real sounds. [Roberto Fresca]

-mc8030 : added random roms, to be sorted [Robbbert]

-p8000: added WDC roms [Robbbert]

-Expose condition for DIP switches, configuration entries, and adjusters. This eliminates ambiguities between settings with
 different conditions and allows a frontend/tool to generate a DIP switch preview. [Vas Crabb]
 * listxml reports it correctly.

-Note Chance: Rearranged the test panel lamps to be D7-->D0. Also arranged the notes to talk about ports and lines instead of lamps.
 Added technical notes about the 4-bit counter found in port FFh. [Roberto Fresca]

-Note Chance: Samples numbered by bank. Recognized a couple of them. [Roberto Fresca]

-new working machine - G-LOC R360 (Japan) [briantro]

-Correct Final Furlong 2 and Crisis Zone Years [sjy96525]
 * In according Final Furlong 2 Titlescreen says 1998: www.nicozon.net/watch/sm11003517 In according Crisis Zone Titlescreen says
    1999 and released in October 1999: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pcjdydg_Xdk

-acorn_dsk: Removed CPN format, now handled with SSD/DSD. [Nigel Barnes]

-psx.xml: Added 76 new dumps, replaced 2 bad dumps (#2712) [aeternal606]
 * Based on the redump.org PSX dat from 2017-10-10, I've added 76 new dumps (mostly demos, cheat applications and Lightspan discs),
    replaced two bad dumps and renamed a couple of original images to keep them synced with their corresponding redump entries.

-stvvdp1.cpp: CEF bit gets reset when the framebuffers get swapped, fixes Twinkle Star Sprites Arcade Mode hang at least
 [Angelo Salese]

-Preliminary SH3 / SH4 recompiler [David Haywood] (#2711) [David Haywood]

-Draw a nominal distinction between PC060HA and TC0140SYT [AJR]

-Corrected notes... [RobertoFresca]

-qix.cpp: added some documentation to the qixb set [ShouTime]

-Explicitly allow floating point values for state registers [AJR]
 * Note that the internal debugger's expression interpreter is not set up to handle floating point values at all, so they remain
    disabled there.

-Added Kaypro 16 [rfka01]

-More inputs behaviour notes... [RobertoFresca]

-Remove duplicated notes... [RobertoFresca]

-Kaypro: Added the Omni 4 Logic Analyzer [rfka01]

-segas16b.cpp: some corrections to Aurail documentation [ekorz]

-ccs2810: Major refinements [AJR]
 * Implement power-on jump in a hardware-accurate manner, including full configuration options.
 * Hook up INS8250 device for RS-232 serial communication. This requires ROM wait states to be (crudely) simulated, or else the baud
    rate recognition routine will mess up its timing.
 * Make serial port address configurable as well (although the monitor still expects it to be at the default setting). This will
    help prepare for S-100 bus emulation.

-new working clone - World Series: The Season (rev 0) [briantro]

-dec0.cpp: updated inputs in all games in the driver [Angelo Salese]
 * Added input labels for most games in the driver, and removed unused buttons;
 * Updated positional rotary for Heavy Barrel/Midnight Resistance to use remap table;
 * Made Boulder Dash to use 4way stick as per manual;

-z80scc: fix interrupt mask generation [Patrick Mackinlay]

-Created a more flexible imgtool::datetime structure for use within Imgtool (#2263) [npwoods]
 * Created a more flexible imgtool::datetime structure for use within Imgtool
 * This is intended to replace most usage of time_t
 * Changing the granularity of imgtool_clock from 1ms to 100ns, as per Vas' suggestion
 * Created arbitrary_datetime in timeconv.h to facilitate interpretation of datetime info
 * I concluded that invoking std::mktime on manually assembled std::tm is bad, because it is indeterminate how the std::tm members
    may be "dominant".  This required that I go further in imgtool, and update a number of drivers and eliminate the parameter of
    imgtool::datetime that takes std::tm.

-S-100 bus refinements [AJR]
 * Make slots subdevices, eliminating the need to hardcode the bus tag
 * Clock the bus and its slots
 * Use correct XTAL for nshrz and add 2MHz variant

-taito_b.cpp: fixed pixel layer offset and enable for Hit the Ice [Angelo Salese]

-Gamate sound is 100% AY8910 compatible according to Kevtris and Peter Wilhelmsen, us the AY8910 core. [David Haywood]

-bt459: new device [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * Used in InterPro graphics boards.

-rewrote the Gamate video implementation from scratch using Kevtris' document and Peter Wilhelmsen's notes this fixes many games, we
 can probably mark them all as supported. [David Haywood]

-gamate: add some mirroring to memory map gamate.xml: mark all software as supported [David Haywood]
 * (next step, make it use a bus / cartridge device instead of protection and banking being hardcoded in driver)

-use slot device for gamate cartridge slot, do protection handling there (it's a mapper chip in the cartridge) protection handled
 etc. written from scratch based on notes from Kevtris and Peter [David Haywood]
 * banking in the slot system seems somewhat archaic compared to proper modern banking, but this is how all other drivers I saw
    using slot roms did it.

-taito_z.cpp: saner interleave CPU timings for Double Axle, attempt to fix road layer getting stuck on continue [Angelo Salese]

-dump 2 new kov3 clones, redump existing v102 set.  new dumps are directly from the rom on the rom+fpga module that plugs in the
 usual rom socket, complete with extra layer of scrambling it provides [XingXing]

-dump 2 new kov3 clones, redump existing v102 set. [DavidHaywood]
-new dumps are dirctly from the rom on the rom+fpga module that plugs in the usual rom socket, complete with extra layer of
 scrambling it provides [XingXing]

-gamate, further improvements, mark software as working as it appears ok. gamate: add some mirroring to memory map, fix AY frequency
 gamate.xml: mark all software as supported [DavidHaywood]
 * (next step, make it use a bus / cartridge device instead of protection and banking being hardcoded in driver)

-rewrote the Gamate video implementation from scratch using Kevtris' document and Peter Wilhelmsen's notes this fixes many games, we
 can probably mark them all as supported. [DavidHaywood]

-bt459: new device Used in InterPro graphics boards. [pmackinlay]

-fmtowns_cd.xml: fix accidental deletion Somehow I deleted a softlist entry while adding the new ones. It's now fixed. [rzero9]

-FM Towns softlists: new missing lists, several additions I have completely revamped the missing lists with about 700 new entries. I
 romanized most of the titles pretty much on my own, but my Japanese isn't quite the best so I may have made some mistakes,
 especially in titles with wordplay or obscure words. A second look at the list would be appreciated. [rzero9]
 * The new lists are based on "FMTOWNS用市販ソフトウェアデータベース Ver.0.3" (http://fmtowns.a.la9.jp/db/sdb.html), which is probably the most
    complete list of commercial software for the FM Towns that exists out there.
 * Also, I have added several of my own dumps, both CD and floppy. See the commits for details.

-document that the 'oldsplus' set identifies as "Oriental Legend 2" when set to Korea The (undumped) protection device internal ARM
 roms provide the region. [DavidHaywood]
 * As this has no external ROM for the ARM we have no way to trojan it out.

-Gamate sound is 100% AY8910 compatible according to Kevtris and Peter Wilhelmsen, use the AY8910 core. there's really no need to
 have a partial reimplementation as GPL code sitting in the audio folder... [DavidHaywood]

-Kaypro: Added the Omni 4 Logic Analyzer Story and files here
 https://hackaday.io/project/20151-floppy-fun-backing-up-a-unique-kay-pro-disk The software runs, but obviously complains about the
 missing i/o board. [rfka01]

-Added Kaypro 16 ROM, manual and disk set are available on the internet (cf. Bannister & FTP) The Kaypro CGA character ROM still
 needs to be dumped, and the harddisk controller originally used in the Kaypro 16 (WD1002-HD0, connected from a mainboard port
 rather than an ISA card) is not emulated yet. The configuration presented here is essentially the Kaypro 16/2, a version without
 harddisk and with two 360K floppies. [rfka01]

-EuroPC: Added first and last known BIOS versions I never saw an earlier or later BIOS version mentioned for the original EuroPC in
 a discussion thread. The 2.04 (and also the 2.05 that is already in MAME) don't work for now because according to one site memory
 management has been changed afterwards. They just show a dash on the top left of the screen. [rfka01]

-fix CPS3/STV (we always use timers for SH2 DMA, and have done for years, just forgot to remove the #ifdef on this code when
 cleaning up) [DavidHaywood]

-psx.xml: Added 76 new dumps, replaced 2 bad dumps Based on the redump.org PSX dat from 2017-10-10, I've added 76 new dumps (mostly
 demos, cheat applications and Lightspan discs), replaced two bad dumps and renamed a couple of original images to keep them synced
 with their corresponding redump entries. [aeternal606]

-SH3 / SH4 recompiler, first pass. This is an SH3 recompiler / preliminary SH4 recompiler.  I would appreciate help with the issues
 listed below (including general cleanups) as I feel at this point I've taken this as far as I can go and am starting to feel burnt
 out with it, so if another team member can take it further that would help immensely. [DavidHaywood]
 * A lot of code has been saved by eliminating all the copy+paste between the sh2 and sh4 cores, they now share a common execution
    engine with the additions in SH3/4 supported using a derived class.  It should be possible to further split these as currently
    the SH3 still has the SH4 functions available (as it did in the original core) however that was not the scope of this initial
    set of changes.
 * The work done allows the SH3/4 cores to use the UML based recompiler.  All the common ops are shared with SH2, while the SH3/4
    specific ones, which are used relatively rarely in the code, are handled with cfunc callbacks like the maths operations on the
    SH2 were.
 * Everything I've tested works exactly the same as it did before when the DRC is turned off.
 * Fastram support etc. from the SH2 core has been implemented
 * The changes made currently works very well for the CaveSH3 (CV1K) driver where the DRC has been enabled.
 * For SH4 based drivers 'MCFG_CPU_FORCE_NO_DRC()' has been used in the individual drivers to turn off the DRC until some bugs are
    fixed.  Currently some Naomi games, such as Crazy Taxi and Capcom vs SNK will boot and run with the DRC if you remove this line
    and enable it and they have noticable performance benefits when using it, however the majority do not boot for reasons unknown.
    If you want to test the Naomi driver with the recompiler make sure to remove the MCFG_CPU_FORCE_NO_DRC() line.
 * Example performance
 * mame64 pinkswts -nodrc -bench 150 Average speed: 458.40% (149 seconds)
 * mame64 pinkswts -bench 150 Average speed: 1027.86% (149 seconds)
 * So speed is more than doubled for the Cave driver.
 * ISSUES:
 * General code tidy up still needed.  public, private, protected members etc. aren't fully verified, and as the sh2 / 4 cores had
    diverged slightly over time there were naming differences etc. for many things, leading to some inconsistency after merging,
    although I've tried to address the majority of these some things could definitely benefit from improved naming.  What belongs in
    each header is up for debate too, the previous core #included some .cpp files, which is never optimal, the new one doesn't, but
    maybe things should still be split up.
 * Doing the address masking when the opcodes are read in the frontend::describe function avoids the need to have extra AM_MIRROR
    ranges required in the individual memory maps (as the proper opcode fetch mirroring is handled internally) however it seems to
    stop the debugger from working, not sure how to fix that.
 * Something goes wrong with the majority of the SH4 based software, so until that's fixed the recompiler has to be disabled for
    those titles.

-mc68901 : fix TCDCR register bits 6-4 are used for timer C bits 2-0 are used for timer D [nplanel]

-dynax.cpp: (tenkai) fix credits lost after exiting the game. The game checks for the the string "A WARNING.IF YOU COPY OUR ITEMS,WE
 REVENGE BY ALL MEANS." at address 0x6E17, and will reset everything if the string does not match when the game starts.
 [CecilHarvey]
 * In the current implementation only 0x7000-0x7fff is saved as nvram after exiting the game, which will cause the string to be
    lost.
 * I'm not sure what the exact nvram address is, but at least this works.

-add apple2_cass tapes Trying to add more tapes. Passed checks first time. After changing feature name from "label" to "part_id" it
 failed a "Travis build" test with an error message about operators. Hopefully it will pass this time because all this is beyond my
 skill set right now. [Dagarman]

-move sh2 / sh4 to a folder called superh the sh3 / sh4 core contains a lot of copy + pasted code from the sh2. [DavidHaywood]
 * the family name is SuperH, so it seems more logical to place them in a folder with that name.
 * the basic execution engine could be shared, the diassembler could be shared (most of it is a straight copy+paste at the moment)
 * sh3/4 add things like fpu ops, mmu, 64-bit data bus but it should otherwise be possible to refactor and rebuild them around the
    existing sh2 core.
 * longer term this should allow leverage of the sh2 recompiler with some modifications (most of the new FPU ops in sh3/sh3 could be
    implemented with the UML cfunc callbacks like some of the existing SH2 maths ops still are, until somebody writes UML
    implementations of them)
 * anyway, this just gets things in place for further refactoring, no actual code changes in this commit.

-Support for HP85 tapes added to imgtool Hi, this PR adds support for HP85 tape images to imgtool. Thanks. [fulivi]

-t4426: promoted to working after clarification from Vas, still needs work [Edstrom]

-Gaelco touchgo improvement - new SRAM dump verified using 2 more boards in order to weed out the bad bytes, image is now trusted
 and correct. [DavidHaywood]
 * also set androidp to 1987, the date is shown during the end credits.

-proteus3: added mc14411 bit rate generator device and replaced the timer based clocks for the ACIA:s [Edstrom]

-add lua translation to makefile and update translations [cracyc]

-Terco 4426 programming station cart banking fixed Still some odd exits to a disabled BASIC prompt for last two main menu options.
 It is probably some memory map issue/main board modification not emulated yet. I will verify this on real hardware before hunting
 the cause of it. [Edstrom]
 * Good news is that it is now possible to write a small CNC program and send it to a printer, or even better, the Terco 4490 CNC
    which is on my to do list to emulate, so the cart is working to an extent.

-Added support for multiple PORT_CHAR() bindings, and adopted in the CoCo driver  (addresses MT#2618) [npwoods]

-Update strings.po for Japanese [k2-git]

-z80sio/z80scc: now returns cpu specific default vector when no interrupt found to acknowledge. I failed to merge this correctly
 before for z80sio, it was merged but disabled. This is fixed now and also implemented this for z80scc. This fix should work for any
 CPU now, not only 68000 as previously. [Edstrom]

-Fixed an options overhaul regression This crash (discovered by Wizz) had the following symptoms: 1.  Start MAME 2.  Choose
 "Configure Machine" 3.  Choose "Video Options" CRASH [npwoods]
 * This was the result of the options editor not having a fully formed list of options where it was expecting one.  The fix is to
    change the declaration of emu_options to one that have full OSD options (it is possible that SDLMAME needs something slightly
    different)
 * Please scrutinize this fix.  I hate it.  I also hate how all of the OSD options are duplicatively declared in submenu.cpp, but
    with a different data structure.  At the very least we should be having some sort of factory to create "full" options for the
    pertinent platform; but I'm not sure how precisely we would want it to work.

-Created a more flexible imgtool::datetime structure for use within Imgtool This is intended to replace most usage of time_t
