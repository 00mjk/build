Last try.. more updates (NW)

Improved note, nw

new clones
Sauro (Recreativo Real S.A. license) [Edcross & Rockman (from Aumap)]

lx810l, ap2000: implement working devices

Improve Epson LX-810L and ActionPrinter 2000 up to a point where they
actually work. Devices boot and enter main input loop, but input is
not yet implemented. It is possible to run the printers' self test.

The code has also been split from lx800.

steppers: move to emu/machine

(nw) Split RSP vector opcodes into separate files for interpreter, 
DRC and DRC + SIMD. Breaks interpreter mode for reasons yet unknown.

pentium: This is the kind of problems you find when a bios uses
 xmm4 as call stack [O. Galibert]

pci: Add grossly hacked smbus [O. Galibert]


pretty sure it's 4:3 vertical when compared with cab pics

(MESS) m5_cart.xml: Added new dump for Pit Chaser cart. [Ola Andersson]

(MESS) softlist: Added a Tandy MC-10 cassette softlist and added several

punctuation
1 more bad byte found in stopthie, confirmed by seanriddle
3rd attempt
(MESS) gamecom : fixed timer in solitaire. Centipede is somewhat playable.
asteroid.c: Add PCB location to the newly built Lunar Lander rom and 
added a comment about it being build from original Atari source code. - NW

Didn't add "BAD_DUMP" marker as that is still in discussion.
Touching all the candy again: [Alex Jackson]

Fixed an annoying inconsistency between memory_share and memory_region:
the width() method of the former returned the width in bits (8, 16, 32 or 64)
while the width() method of the latter returned the width in bytes
(1, 2, 4 or 8). Now both classes have a bitwidth() method and a bytewidth()
method. Updated all callers to use whichever one was more appropriate.

Removed the implicit-cast-to-any-integer-pointer ability of memory_regions,
which was rather unsafe (if you weren't careful with your * operators and
casts it was easy to accidentally get a pointer to the memory_region object
itself instead of to the data, with no warning from the compiler... or at
least I kept doing it) Updated all devices and drivers that were accessing
regions that way to use a region_ptr_finder when possible, and otherwise to
call base() explicitly.

Added language rom for Lunar Lander [Mariusz Wojcieszek]

Fixed mikrosha.c regression (nw)
rsp: Made the RSP interpreter core functional again. [MooglyGuy]

nw
cleanup
ngen: mapped DMA controller, no idea what DMA channels map to what devices, yet.

(MESS) gamecom : fixed calculator
(MESS) apple2: fix up laser128 series to boot again. (nw)

tmaster.c: minor updates - NW

All versions of Touchmaster run on the same PCB so there should only be 
one basic machine config. The OKI samples play too slow at 1MHz and too 
fast at 2Mhz as compared to a real machine. So 1.5Mhz is use as derived
 by actual OSC 24Mhz devided by 16. - NW
 
Fix for "required objects" fatalerror for 386i and ngen38.

tmaster.c: Fix key name - NW

The Touchmaster 7000 Eval was a chip swap for Touchmaster 5000 for
operators to evaluate the next version so it uses the TM5000 security 
key. - NW
More Mac fixes (nw)

OS X compile fix (nw)

[MESS] apple2: rewrote all 8-bit Apple II drivers with an aim towards 
modernity and improved runtime performance, improved correctness, and
missing features.  Fixes MT #5157, 5158, 5747, and 5748. [R. Belmont]

ngen: mapped i8254, connected channel 2 to the serial clock, added
 RS232 ports and connected them to the uPD7201.

drawgfx.h: Long-overdue documentation about how to use priority-masked
drawing (aka pdrawgfx); add some useful constants. [Alex Jackson]

(nw)
prehisle.c: Fix issues introduced by pdrawgfx conversion; use
required_region_ptr instead of runtime tag lookup; give gfx regions
more meaningful names; remove superfluous "prehisle"'s and "16"'s
from member names (it's been many years since you could accidentally
plug a handler of the wrong width into an address map and not have
the core catch you at compile time)

Add chip name for confirmed acan dumps

mc1502: mark CGA unremovable from its slot.
nw
made plaparse less strict about whitespace and ordering, and
 added .phase keyword

tilemap.c internal documentation update; dooyong.c cleanups; prehisle.c pdrawgfx conversion
didn't mean to remove the chip diagram
mc1502: mark CGA unremovable from its slot.

mame.lst: Account for set rename - NW

lethal.c: sanify palette size and bankdev address map; add placeholder 
for gfx ROM read (nw)
(MESS) gamecom : privacy
goldngam.c, popobear.c: fix unsafe casts pointed out by Aaron comments; 
the other driver with such comments, crystal.c, is a lost cause (nw)
Make prehisle use proper priority rather than two-pass sprite rendering,
 clean up a little

More dooyong cleanup

Sonic 2 (bootleg of Megadrive version) [caius]

needs correct coin logic (mcu sim?) hooking up for this bootleg, looks like a 
nasty hack, time counter is accelerated (so really you don't have long to

Taito device tilemap assert fixes, and clean up of obsolete stuff (nw)

steppers: add absolute position

upd7810: use intermediate flip flops for extended timer/event counter
peplus.c: Slight update - NW
peplus.c: Documentation update - NW
steppers: add absolute position

upd7810: use intermediate flip flops for extended timer/event counter

The extended timer/event counter uses intermediate flip flops (LV0 and
LV1) before writing the output to CO0 and CO1.

The introduction of LV0/LV1 addresses three issues:
- Level inversion occurs after the flip flop is output, not before;
- The intermediate flip flop can be altered without affecting the
	output of CO0/CO1;
- upd7810_write_EOM() didn't work properly when the level inversion
	bit was set along other bits.

very weird set dumped by Robbie, might even be an original codebase, has a 2 
player simultaneous mode (not as polished as Pacman Twin) need to fins the

how it's programmed, or if there's something else going on.

asst128: has joystick port
asst128: has joystick port

added assert for usage of uninitialized stack memory in n64_rdp::SpanDraw1Cycle() (nw)

happens with e.g. n64 -cart vprowrs2 - it actually already goes out of
bounds in poly_manager::render_triangle_custom() but since that code is
generic it's hard to add an assert there / also added another FBSize
check

added another check for unsupported FBSize (nw)

happens with n64 -cart sbowlingj

The timer/event counter outputs (CO0 and CO1) are set differently when

cleared on use. The document at [0] is confusing regarding these bits.
An older document [1], easier to understand, was used instead.

Update README.md

Update of readme
bit of a driver specific hack to work around what seems to be a core 
problem when you have multiple screens of different refresh rates and
 partial updates.

not marked the game as working yet because the side screens seem to

Start converting the various Hard Drivin' board types to be devices, 
allowing me to add the 2 additional video boards to Race Drivin' Panorama.

This brings Race Drivin' Panorama to within an inch of working, however
 there seems to be what I think is a core bug with partial updates on 
 anything except the primary screen, meaning the other screens fail to 
 update properly.  It isn't a communicaiton issue ,as you can swap the 
 screens around and get the other screens updating smoothly instead, it
 just doesn't seem to want to update the screen when it should.  With a
 tiny bit more work this could be marked as working.

Also added default eeproms for each of the sub-boards with the views
 correctly setup.

get rid of some global stuff by making this a device, need this step 
for now, will improve further later (nw)

upd7810: return meaningful value when PC3 is in control mode

When PC3 is in control mode, it acts as INT2 and external Timer Input.
INT2 may be set by connected devices through set_input_line(), so its
value can be used when reading or writing to PC3. There is currently
no code to support external timer input.

upd7810: correctly deal with external interrupts

upd7810: treat NMI like other interrupts

upd7810: remove gamemaster hack for INTFE1

The extended timer has been properly implemented in upd7810.
Tested with Continental Galaxy 2020.

out of whatsnew:
This allows the flash calculators to properly reset pc to 0x0000 instead
	of 0x8000 and properly reset all memory banks to page 0x00.

This is based on some example code Judge. Possibly performance improvement 
could be gained by having the callback unregister itself and register on reset.

(MESS) spc1000: converted the expansion bus EXT1 to be a
slot device, moved FDD expansion to be a slot card, added
emulation of the VDP expansion as another slot card. This
makes Gun Fright, TwinBee and Zanac playable if you launch
them with "-ext1 vdp" option. If you want to emulate a
SPC-1000 with floppy drive, you have to add "-ext1 fdd"
instead. [Fabio Priuli]

out of whatsnew: disk emulation still does not work (unless we use
Meeso Kim's patched BIOS), but emulation is now closer to the real
functionality and we needed the changes for the VDP unit emulation.

The method used was a suggestion from RB

calchase.c:  [Peter Ferrie]
	* Implemented missing DIP switch for Eggs Playing Chicken, promote to working. 
	Press "S" to skip the CMOS error, "S" or wait to skip the emm386.exe error
	(not an emulation issue), use "Coin 2" to
coin-up and start the game, and "1 Player Start" to brake.

calchase.c, gamecstl.c, midqslvr.c, queen.c, savquest.c, taitowlf.c,
voyager.c, xtom3d.c:  [Peter Ferrie]
	* Intel component is not MXTC, it's MTXC.

	and TI84 Plus Silver Edition by switching over to bankdev and adding proper flash chips.
	They should be working now (press Q to power on).


Out of whatsnew:
ti84p was not added to mess.lst becuase rom is not available yet. 
 Current romload is same CRC as ti84pse but at a smaller size.  Once corrected and obtained it should work.

more devfind: [Alex Jackson]

Renamed rom_ptr_finder to region_ptr_finder after discussion with Aaron.
First round of memory_region_finder to region_ptr_finder conversions.

rf5c400: use a region_ptr_finder to find our sound ROM instead of looking up
the region by hand in device_start(). Will probably start converting other
sound devices to this pattern (other than the ones that use the memory system)
if there are no problems or objections.

devfind: Add rom_ptr_finder, which works like shared_ptr_finder
except it finds a ROM region instead of a memory share.
Unlike the old memory_region_finder, these can be accessed without
any overhead (since it's a pointer directly to the data and not
to the memory_region object), can be whatever data type you want
(no casting needed) and are strictly type-checked--if you have a
required_rom_ptr<UINT32> the region has to be a ROM_REGION32
(or an implicitly 32-bit region due to belonging to a CPU) or
the finder won't find it and will tell you why.

Basically, rom_ptr_finders are strictly better than
memory_region_finders and all drivers using the latter should be
converted over. I've done megasys1.c and twin16.c as examples.

megasys1: Use a device address map for the peekaboo oki instead
of memcpy().

twin16: Convert the scrolling layers to tilemaps (the fixed text
layer was already one). Miscellaneous cleanups/modernizations.

(nw)

Notice that rom_ptr_finder has a length() method which returns the
length in whatever size unit the pointer is, instead of a bytes()
method. Yes, I'm going to convert shared_ptr_finder to match, since
this way makes a lot more sense (in particular, mask() is useless
for shared_ptrs that are anything other than INT8/UINT8)

(MESS) a1bus: licensing and save state cleanups (nw)


gts80b.c : WIP
