-netlist: Make sure diodes step enough ... [Couriersud]
 * Long story: The diode model uses log-stepping as proposed in "Circuit Simulation" (Farid N. Najm) page 183. If the previous
    voltage was sufficiently negative the new voltage after a log step could not have increased enough to alter matrix and rhs
    vector. This bug surfaced in stuntcyc video signal mixing which uses a diode for the composite signal.

-netlist: Increase resolution to 100 pico seconds. [Couriersud]
 * Increase the time resolution from 1 nano second to 100 pico seconds. Make sure that icount and netlist internal time are better
    synched by tracking the remainder of the division. Fixed the netlist sound device. There is a one sample overflow every 13
    seconds at 48000 Hz due to integer truncation which is now ignored. Added more doxygen documentation.

-apply2 floppy format: bake in the track count [68bit]
 * The APPLE2_TRACK_COUNT macro was not being expanded here, at least on gcc8. This resulted in the string "APPLE2_TRACK_COUNT"
    being within the specification and that in turn broke option_resolution::lookup_in_specification leading to an assertion fail
    with the debug checks enabled. So bake in the numeric constant to at least get things working again.
