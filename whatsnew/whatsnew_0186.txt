 * Moved state class out of MACHINE_CONFIG_START, eliminating need for MACHINE_CONFIG_FRAGMENT and MACHINE_CONFIG_DERIVED_CLASS.
 * Made game drivers add machine configuration in the same way as any other device.

 * Have set_unscaled_clock and set_clock_scale not call notify_clock_changed unless the device has been started.
 * Owner-derived clocks are now updated whenever the owner's clock is changed, including at configuration time. This simplifies the
    configuration of various NES clones.

    Previously, core_options was designed to provide an input/output facility for reading options from the command line and INI
    files. However, the current needs (image/slot/get_default_card_software calculus and MewUI) go way beyond that.
 * Broadly, this PR makes the following changes:
 * core_options now has an extensibility mechanism, so one can register options that behave dramatically differently
 * With that foundation, emu_options now encapsulates all of the funky image/slot/get_default_card_software calculus that were
    previously handled by static methods in mameopts.cpp. Changes to emu_options should not automatically cascade in such a way so
    that it stays in a consistent state
 * emu_options no longer provides direct access to the slot_options/image_options maps; there are simpler API functions that control
    these capabilities
 * Many core_options functions that expose internal data structures (e.g. - priority) that were only really needed because of
    previous (now obsolete) techniques have been removed.
 * core_options is now exception based (rather than dumping text to an std::string). The burden is on the caller to catch these, and
    discern between warnings and errors as needed.
 * Obviously this is a risky change; that's why this is being submitted at the start of the dev cycle.

-Revert "Overhaul to how MAME handles options (#2260)" [Vas Crabb]
 * This reverts commit 536990e77b49ccc50ef275bfbf1018cc29c16154.
 * Conflicts: src/frontend/mame/mame.cpp
 * Sorry, but this change was half-baked.  It breaks a lot of existing functionality and clearly hasn't been tested in more than a
    tiny subset of use cases.  Please play this work back onto your own branch, and test it before submitting another PR.

-Cleanups to src/frontend/mame/ui/slotopt.[cpp|h] [Nathan Woods]
 * Did the following: 1.  Polished up residual traces of this code's pre-C++ heritage 2.  Moved completely private code to an
    anonymous namespace 3.  Created device_slot_interface::slot_name() to wrap the pattern of taking the tag and removing the
    initial colon

-Bug fix to -romident and aux verb cleanup (#2288) [npwoods]
 * Bug fix to -romident and aux verb cleanup
 * Made the following changes: 1.  Fixed a bug where resolved slot/image options would choke -romident (reproducible in MAME 0.185
    with 'mame64 -romident coco.zip') 2.  'mame64 -romident' no longer crashes (though it doesn't do anything useful) 3.  Changed
    the aux verb functions to take 'const std::string &'
 * Further cleanups to auxillary verb code, as per Vas
 * Specifically: 1.  The commands themselves now take 'const std::vector<std::string> &' for their argument lists 2.
    util::core_options now collects command arguments into a separate vector rather than treating them as unadorned arguments
 * Vas Crabb feedback
 * Now only using trim_spaces_and_quotes() when parsing INIs
 * Vas pointed out that it is inappropriate to trim spaces and quotes when parsing command line options

-Revert "Bug fix to -romident and aux verb cleanup (#2288)" [Vas Crabb]

-fix mitchell.cpp nvram saving [D. Haywood]

-mitchell.cpp : just use the finder method for nvram [David Haywood]

-mitchell.cpp : just use the finder method for nvram since after the last submission we're now saving the whole ram and don't have
 the provisional code to go back we can just use the built in finder rather than set_base [DavidHaywood]

-fix mitchell.cpp nvram saving this must have been broken for a while, it was assuming that MAME used the CPU region as RAM for
 8-bit CPUs and that hasn't been an valid for a long time. (15+ years?)  As a result data wasn't being saved / restored properly at
 all. [DavidHaywood]
 * Corrado Tomaselli noticed this when playing with his Super Pang PCB, after replacing a hacked set with a proper original + Kabuki
    battery he noticed the game no longer showed '8Mhz Original Board' on bootup.  This is because the battery also backs up at
    least part of main RAM, and it only displays that string the first time it initializes main ram.
 * The previous MAME code only tried to save 0x80 bytes of the RAM, with a different location for some games.  I've left that
    behavior commented in case it turns out the original does only save that area, but it seems more likely it just backs up the
    whole of the RAM.

 * Various InterPro changes:
 * fixed cpu/mmu ssw bug
 * added preliminary nscsi support
 * added preliminary mmu address translation
 * expanded memory maps for several devices
 * improved irq and dma handling (still not working properly)
 * stubbed out more sga registers, added srarb
 * For the following, I don't really know what I'm doing, so please check carefully:
 * WARNING: includes a naive addition of ncr53c94 support to ncr5390.cpp
 * WARNING: adds a start/stop unit command to t10spc.cpp
 * After these changes, ip2800 boots to FDM prompt with a ton of memdiag test failures, but not much else is visibly improved.

-basic VT03 support [David Haywood]

-ti99: Changes to peripheral handling [Michael Zapf]
 * Major rearrangement of the bus/ti99 subtree; using namespaces now.
   Moving all ti99 stuff from ti99x into the "internal" subtree.
 * Big all-in-one file gromport.cpp split into separate device files,
   introducing "gromport" as a bus of its own.
 * Added console connector "ioport" with PEB as slot option. PEB will now
   be plugged in, instead of being a subdevice; requiring update of slot
   options for emulation start of TI-99/4/4A/8. No changes to Geneve and
   TI-99/4P. ti99_4ev finds PEB plugged in as default, together with the EVPC
   so that we have a default video output.

-mrflea: Use PPIs for interboard communication and PIC for sub interrupt [AJR]

-Retired min/max in attotime.h, in favor of std::[min|max]() [Nathan Woods]

-Fixed 2 bugs: [Robbbert]
 1. If either a multipart softlist item was loaded, or a single-part item loaded into a system with more than one of
 the same media slot, then a reset would cause a fatal error.
 2. If a non-existing image was listed in the ini, it would fatal error at start and there was no way to fix it except
 by hand-editing the ini file. This restores the previous behaviour of ejecting the bad image with the first error.

-cheekyms: add preliminary netlist sound based on schematics provided by Sam Grech [Vas Crabb]

-Preliminary netlist sound for the Zaccaria 1B11142 board [Vas Crabb]
 * Tromba (trumpet) sound is not working - requires Schmitt trigger device
 * Connecting cassa (bass drum) swamps other instruments so it's disconnected for now
 * Mixing melody sound with speech/SFX is not done in netlist (should be)
 * Relative levels of melody/speech/SFX are probably still wrong

-Changed Solver.PARALLEL parameter logic: [couriersud]
 * 0: Parallel processing of solvers disabled 1: One processor parallel processing. Can be used to measure OPENMP overhead >1: Solve
    n analog subnets in parallel.
 * Previously, all available processors were used which caused performance to degrade on hyperthreading. [Couriersud]

-Netlist refactoring: [couriersud]
 * OPENMP refactored. All OPENMP operations are now templatized in pomp.h

-New Machine Added [briantro]

-netlist: add a crude TTL schmitt trigger model and hook up in 1B11142 sound board, completing the tromba circuit [Vas Crabb]

-Add rand() function to pfunction expression parser. Use this to simulate E-B noise in Cheeky Mouse and fix the "cheese" choose.

 * While this is a degenerate scenario, this should be fixed

-Retired min/max in attotime.h, in favor of std::[min|max]() [npwoods]

-preliminary steps for basic VT03 (NES clone) support VT03 is a clone of the NES hardware but with extended capabilities such as
 4bpp tiles, an extended palette and it's own banking schemes.  The VT family of chips are used by the vast majority of recent
 'famiclone' systems, often standalone devices with a number of built in games and no cartridge slot.  Later models add 8bpp modes
 and even more complex banking schemes. [DavidHaywood]
 * This allows derived classes to extend the PPU functionality to support the basic modes.
 * mc_dgear has been moved from nes.xml to this driver (as it's not something that could actually run on a NES) and several other
    dumps from what should be VT based machines have been added, although some use later models.  cybar120 boots but you can see it
    appears to need an 8bpp mode.  Most of the others don't boot yet.
 * for mc_dgear 'Shark', 'Octopus', 'Harbor', and 'Earth Fighter' use the extended palette / 4bpp mode, although the actual palette
    decoding needs work even if the tiles are now correctly decoded.
 * To my knowledge the only other emulator for these is EmuVT which is an illegal chinese made hack of Nester (Nester is GPL, but no
    sources for EmuVT were ever released) and the documentation out there doesn't cover all features, and in some cases isn't
    entirely correct.
 * Submitting now as it was a lot of work just keeping this in sync with the latest changes.

-Remove starshp1 hack to restore correct behavior A very old (> 10 years?) hack seemed to clean up the way the ships explode in
 Atari Starship 1.  But this is different than the actual game behavior.  See this video of the way the ships behave when they are

-Visible area fixed. [jfdelnero]

-via6522 shifter support for external clock The regression of the Mac adb bus support caused me to refactor the shifter and I feel
 much better about this implementation as it got rid of ugly sub states and purely handles flanks now as opposed to a mix of flanks
 and cycles before. In my regression tests I noticed that some systems seems to work a bit better and of course both Mac adb bus and
 the Prodigy. Let me know any problems asap [JoakimLarsson]

-Overhaul to how MAME handles options This is an overhaul to how MAME handles options to provide a better foundation for what MAME
 is already doing in practice.  Previously, core_options was designed to provide an input/output facility for reading options from
 the command line and INI files.  However, the current needs (image/slot/get_default_card_software calculus and MewUI) go way beyond
 that. [npwoods]
 * Broadly, this PR makes the following changes:
 * core_options now has an extensibility mechanism, so one can register options that behave dramatically differently
 * With that foundation, emu_options now encapsulates all of the funky image/slot/get_default_card_software calculus that were
    previously handled by static methods in mameopts.cpp.  Changes to emu_options should not automatically cascade in such a way so
    that it stays in a consistent state
 * emu_options no longer provides direct access to the slot_options/image_options maps; there are simpler API functions that control
    these capabilities
 * Many core_options functions that expose internal data structures (e.g. - priority) that were only really needed because of
    previous (now obsolete) techniques have been removed.
 * core_options is now exception based (rather than dumping text to an std::string).  The burden is on the caller to catch these,
    and discern between warnings and errors as needed.
 * Obviously this is a risky change; that's why this is being submitted at the start of the dev cycle.

-Mechanism for devices to generate clocks for other devices The dynamic DERIVED_CLOCK part of this actually works on a similar
 principle to #2140, but reuses an existing member of device_t instead of adding two new ones. This does change configured_clock()
 to return an unresolved value for derived clocks, but nothing directly accesses that parameter outside of device_t anyway.

he also dumped a Football Champ board only to find the content was the same despite using a different Taito number for the rom that

  coinage etc.)  this has been documented and the longname for the set updated to reflect the switchable title. [David Haywood]

  it likely has it's own Taito product code (although we don't currently have the correct ROM names for it) [David Haywood]
Wonder Boy (set 6, 315-5179) [Mathieu Patard]
he also dumped a Football Champ board only to find the content was the same despite using a different Taito number for the rom that
  determines the region, so it's likely one of them is incorrect *or* because in this case a Dipswitch determines the title, Taito
  might have actually shipped the same rom with different numbers (seems less likely tho, because the region byte also affects
  coinage etc.)  this has been documented and the longname for the set updated to reflect the switchable title. [DavidHaywood]
Also while I was looking there I made euroch92 not a clone as it follows the 'sf2ce' rule, it's a re-released game with small
  updates, not an identical product, it likely has it's own Taito product code (although we don't currently have the correct ROM
  names for it) [DavidHaywood]
PCB images etc. have been submitted. [DavidHaywood]
