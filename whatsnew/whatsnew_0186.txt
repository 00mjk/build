 * Moved state class out of MACHINE_CONFIG_START, eliminating need for MACHINE_CONFIG_FRAGMENT and MACHINE_CONFIG_DERIVED_CLASS.
 * Made game drivers add machine configuration in the same way as any other device.
 * Added support for machine configuration in device members, allowing many internal handlers to be made protected or private.
 * Moved many constants used internally by devices out of headers and into source files.
 * Converted many constants to scoped enums, and reduced scope of many constants and types.

 * Have set_unscaled_clock and set_clock_scale not call notify_clock_changed unless the device has been started.
 * Owner-derived clocks are now updated whenever the owner's clock is changed, including at configuration time. This simplifies the
    configuration of various NES clones.

 [Nathan Woods]
 * This was not guaranteed to cause a problem; the specific issue here was reported by mr_gw in the context of the CoCo, and the
    proximate issue (hanging) was in CoCo-specific code.   That said, this could cause problems elsewhere.

-[Imgtool] Cleanups to validity code, and transitioned to std::wcerr [Nathan Woods]

-scyclone.cpp: more work [David Haywood]
 * added sprite colours, basic starfield (rendering isn't correct, eg. no twinkle, uncertain star positions);
 * documented what is probably a hw collision bit as you can't destroy the large sprites with it off, but if you turn it on all the
    time then a shot in the corner will cause the game to lock up repeating the explosion sequence over and over;

 * draw_char_40 & draw_char_80 : use of std::min.
 * Fix invalid instructions length. Each 6800 invalid opcodes have a different behavior. This commit fix the PC increment of each
    invalid opcode execution. There is three groups of invalid opcodes :
 * One byte invalid opcodes/instructions :
 * 00,02,03,04,05,12,13,15,18,1A,1C,1D,1E,1F,21, 38,3A,3C,3D,41,42,45,4B,4E,51,52,55,5B,5E

-via6522: fixed the flank timer value which improved but not completelly reverted the vectrex regression [Joakim Larsson Edstrom]

-acommand: Use tilemap device [AJR]

-Overhaul to how MAME handles options (#2260) [npwoods]
 * This is an overhaul to how MAME handles options to provide a better foundation for what MAME is already doing in practice.
    Previously, core_options was designed to provide an input/output facility for reading options from the command line and INI
    files. However, the current needs (image/slot/get_default_card_software calculus and MewUI) go way beyond that.
 * Broadly, this PR makes the following changes:
 * core_options now has an extensibility mechanism, so one can register options that behave dramatically differently
 * With that foundation, emu_options now encapsulates all of the funky image/slot/get_default_card_software calculus that were
    previously handled by static methods in mameopts.cpp. Changes to emu_options should not automatically cascade in such a way so
    that it stays in a consistent state
 * emu_options no longer provides direct access to the slot_options/image_options maps; there are simpler API functions that control
    these capabilities
 * Many core_options functions that expose internal data structures (e.g. - priority) that were only really needed because of
    previous (now obsolete) techniques have been removed.
 * core_options is now exception based (rather than dumping text to an std::string). The burden is on the caller to catch these, and
    discern between warnings and errors as needed.
 * Obviously this is a risky change; that's why this is being submitted at the start of the dev cycle.

 * Conflicts: src/frontend/mame/mame.cpp
 * Sorry, but this change was half-baked.  It breaks a lot of existing functionality and clearly hasn't been tested in more than a
    tiny subset of use cases.  Please play this work back onto your own branch, and test it before submitting another PR.

-namcos11.cpp: Let's call Star Sweep (STP2/VER.A) the Asia version [briantro]

 * Made the following changes: 1.  Fixed a bug where resolved slot/image options would choke -romident (reproducible in MAME 0.185
    with 'mame64 -romident coco.zip') 2.  'mame64 -romident' no longer crashes (though it doesn't do anything useful) 3.  Changed
    the aux verb functions to take 'const std::string &'
 * Further cleanups to auxillary verb code, as per Vas
 * Specifically: 1.  The commands themselves now take 'const std::vector<std::string> &' for their argument lists 2.
    util::core_options now collects command arguments into a separate vector rather than treating them as unadorned arguments
 * Vas Crabb feedback
 * Now only using trim_spaces_and_quotes() when parsing INIs

 * Most of these appear to be typos that should be benign but due to MSVC bugs, are not benign
 * The dac.h 'bits' thing is just stupid

-Adding hack to fish hashpath option out of INI files prior to softlist evaluation [Nathan Woods]
 * eientei95 reported an error where the hashpath specified in INI files was not being honored in softlist evaluation.  This is a

-Retired min/max in attotime.h, in favor of std::[min|max]() [Nathan Woods]

-Fixed 2 bugs 1. If either a multipart softlist item was loaded, or a single-part item loaded into a system with more than one of
 the same media slot, then a reset would cause a fatal error. 2. If a non-existing image was listed in the ini, it would fatal error
 at start and there was no way to fix it except by hand-editing the ini file. This restores the previous behaviour of ejecting the
 bad image with the first error. [Robbbert]

-ti99: Created bus gromport, split monster file gromport [Michael Zapf]

-Machine promoted to WORKING Hashire Patrol Car [MetalliC]

-segas18.cpp: dumped later ver of Shadow Dancer sound CPU ROM, document main program EPR labels [rtw]

-model1.cpp: Implement workaround for race condition that caused vf to lose sound (MT #6587). This fix causes swa to show an error
 message before booting normally, due to the I/O board not being emulated properly in the first place. [AJR]

-cheekyms: add preliminary netlist sound based on schematics provided by Sam Grech [Vas Crabb]

-Preliminary netlist sound for the Zaccaria 1B11142 board [Vas Crabb]
 * Tromba (trumpet) sound is not working - requires Schmitt trigger device
 * Connecting cassa (bass drum) swamps other instruments so it's disconnected for now
 * Mixing melody sound with speech/SFX is not done in netlist (should be)
 * Relative levels of melody/speech/SFX are probably still wrong

-Changed Solver.PARALLEL parameter logic: [couriersud]
 * 0: Parallel processing of solvers disabled 1: One processor parallel processing. Can be used to measure OPENMP overhead >1: Solve
    n analog subnets in parallel.
 * Previously, all available processors were used which caused performance to degrade on hyperthreading. [Couriersud]

-Netlist refactoring: [couriersud]
 * OPENMP refactored. All OPENMP operations are now templatized in pomp.h

-New Machine Added [briantro]

-netlist: add a crude TTL schmitt trigger model and hook up in 1B11142 sound board, completing the tromba circuit [Vas Crabb]

-Add rand() function to pfunction expression parser. Use this to simulate E-B noise in Cheeky Mouse and fix the "cheese" choose.
 [Couriersud]

-Fix issues identified by Vas and LordKale4: [couriersud]
 * made local netlists in Cheeky Mouse static
 * replace stdlib rand by 16 bit galois lfsr

-ti99: Change ioport default to peb for ti99_4ev, also add evpc automatically [Michael Zapf]

-liberate.cpp: All PSGs are AY-3-8912A [AJR]

-Fixed issue when the hash length is zero (#2314) [npwoods]
 * Fixed issue when the hash length is zero
 * The following is illegal, even if no elements in the pointer are accessed:
 * std::vector<my_struct> my_vec(0); // create an empty std::vector my_struct *ptr = &my_vec[0];
 * While this is a degenerate scenario, this should be fixed

-Retired min/max in attotime.h, in favor of std::[min|max]() [npwoods]

-preliminary steps for basic VT03 (NES clone) support VT03 is a clone of the NES hardware but with extended capabilities such as
 4bpp tiles, an extended palette and it's own banking schemes.  The VT family of chips are used by the vast majority of recent
 'famiclone' systems, often standalone devices with a number of built in games and no cartridge slot.  Later models add 8bpp modes
 and even more complex banking schemes. [DavidHaywood]
 * This allows derived classes to extend the PPU functionality to support the basic modes.
 * mc_dgear has been moved from nes.xml to this driver (as it's not something that could actually run on a NES) and several other
    dumps from what should be VT based machines have been added, although some use later models.  cybar120 boots but you can see it
    appears to need an 8bpp mode.  Most of the others don't boot yet.
 * for mc_dgear 'Shark', 'Octopus', 'Harbor', and 'Earth Fighter' use the extended palette / 4bpp mode, although the actual palette
    decoding needs work even if the tiles are now correctly decoded.
 * To my knowledge the only other emulator for these is EmuVT which is an illegal chinese made hack of Nester (Nester is GPL, but no
    sources for EmuVT were ever released) and the documentation out there doesn't cover all features, and in some cases isn't
    entirely correct.
 * Submitting now as it was a lot of work just keeping this in sync with the latest changes.

-interpro improvements, plus some naive scsi hacks Various InterPro changes: [pmackinlay]
 * fixed cpu/mmu ssw bug
 * added preliminary nscsi support
 * added preliminary mmu address translation
 * expanded memory maps for several devices
 * improved irq and dma handling (still not working properly)
 * stubbed out more sga registers, added srarb
 * For the following, I don't really know what I'm doing, so please check carefully:
 * WARNING: includes a naïve addition of ncr53c94 support to ncr5390.cpp
 * WARNING: adds a start/stop unit command to t10spc.cpp
 * After these changes, ip2800 boots to FDM prompt with a ton of memdiag test failures, but not much else is visibly improved.

-Update luaengine.rst I recently bumped into this problem while trying to develop a script and couldn't find adequate documentation
 or examples for the newest Mame version [DanAmador]

-Fixed some inaccuracies in file names in lua scripts. [dankan1890]

-Fix for a segfault when emulating HP9895 drive (take 2) Hi, this is the 2nd attempt to fix the bug that sometimes caused segfaults
 when emulating hp9895 drive. My previous attempt was in PR #2319. I think this addresses the problem better. It was due to a
 rounding error in floppy_image_device::find_position function that overflowed the "sacred" 2E+8 limit. Thanks. [fulivi]
 * -F.Ulivi

-Cleanups to ram_device Specifically: 1.  Changed ram_device to expose specific options, removing the burden for clients to parse
 RAM strings 2.  Moved validation of command line arguments out of device_validity_check(); that method is only intended for
 checking the device itself 3.  Miscellaneous polishing [npwoods]

-Fixed a regression in -listmedia/-listslots The issue is that -listmedia/-listslots were not honoring command line options
 specified on the slot.  This works around the problem. [npwoods]

-r9751: Add terminal keyboard callback [bmunger]

-mitchell.cpp : just use the finder method for nvram since after the last submission we're now saving the whole ram and don't have
 the provisional code to go back we can just use the built in finder rather than set_base [DavidHaywood]

-fix mitchell.cpp nvram saving this must have been broken for a while, it was assuming that MAME used the CPU region as RAM for
 8-bit CPUs and that hasn't been an valid for a long time. (15+ years?)  As a result data wasn't being saved / restored properly at
 all. [DavidHaywood]
 * Corrado Tomaselli noticed this when playing with his Super Pang PCB, after replacing a hacked set with a proper original + Kabuki
    battery he noticed the game no longer showed '8Mhz Original Board' on bootup.  This is because the battery also backs up at
    least part of main RAM, and it only displays that string the first time it initializes main ram.
 * The previous MAME code only tried to save 0x80 bytes of the RAM, with a different location for some games.  I've left that
    behavior commented in case it turns out the original does only save that area, but it seems more likely it just backs up the
    whole of the RAM.

-Fix video_manager::throttle_until_ticks (#2309) Do not update m_average_oversleep if we overslept too much. This is still a partial
 fix, more investigation is needed when the system time jumps backward. [057a3dd61f99517a3afea0051a49cb27994f94d]

-Fixed issue when the hash length is zero The following is illegal, even if no elements in the pointer are accessed: [npwoods]
 * std::vector<my_struct> my_vec(0); // create an empty std::vector my_struct *ptr = &my_vec[0];
 * While this is a degenerate scenario, this should be fixed

-Add support for ULTRA ROM on the Heathkit H19 [mgarlanger]

-clones from Mathieu Patard [DavidHaywood]

-Hp9845: Support for HPI floppy format Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR introduces the handling of HPI floppy image format. This format is used to store the image of the HP-formatted 8" floppy
    disks used in hp9895a drive. Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-Starting from the Favorites menu now starts the software list submenu (if necessary). Question outside the pull request: why are
 the previous commites counted that there is nothing to do with the PR? [dankan1890]

-Games Master Cartridge slot device for the Color Computer Adds a new slot device to emulate the Games Master Cartridge developed by
 John Linville. [tlindner]

-Adding hack to fish hashpath option out of INI files prior to softlist evaluation eientei95 reported an error where the hashpath
 specified in INI files was not being honored in softlist evaluation.  This is a change to preprocess INI files for the sole purpose
 of finding the hashpath prior to evaluating softlists. [npwoods]

-Fixed various issues that failed when compiling Vas' changes on MSVC Most of these appear to be typos that should be benign but due
 to MSVC bugs, are not benign [npwoods]
 * The dac.h 'bits' thing is just stupid

-linenoise work Linenoise-ng uses convertutf.cpp which apparently has a dodgy license and Debian removes it in their build.  It also
 is overly complex.  I'm replacing it with a simpler port that has an MIT licensed UTF8 parser and moving more completion logic into
 lua enabling better completions.  Doing as a PR for suggestions and compile testing. [cracyc]

-Lua scripts cleanup. [dankan1890]

-aristmk4, aristmk5, aristmk6 - extra sets and improved documentation [Heihachi_73] (submitted on behalf of Heihachi_73, not my
 submission) [DavidHaywood]

-Bug fix to -romident and aux verb cleanup (take two) Earlier I was handling 'mame64 -listsource pacman' but not 'mame64 pacman
 -listsource' [npwoods]

-audio fixed Audio is completely reversed. When the correct answer is red, "to up the white" sound played. [k2-git]

 * Please See also...(real machine photo) http://k1world2.seesaa.net/upload/detail/image/image-668f7-thumbnail2.jpg.html

-Replaced the checksums with correct checksums. The MCPX 1.0 ROM had the wrong checksums. The checksums included were from a known
 bad copy of the ROM. [mark-riley]

-Changed 'int ignore_warnings' parameter on core_options::parse_ini_file() to be 'bool ignore_unknown_options' [npwoods]

-Cleanups to src/frontend/mame/ui/slotopt.[cpp|h] Did the following: 1.  Polished up residual traces of this code's pre-C++ heritage
 2.  Moved completely private code to an anonymous namespace 3.  Created device_slot_interface::slot_name() to wrap the pattern of
 taking the tag and removing the initial colon [npwoods]

-Improve Critter Crusher / Tatacot Gun Control [sjy96525]

-Bug fix to -romident and aux verb cleanup Made the following changes: 1.  Fixed a bug where resolved slot/image options would choke
 -romident (reproducible in MAME 0.185 with 'mame64 -romident coco.zip') 2.  'mame64 -romident' no longer crashes (though it doesn't
 do anything useful) 3.  Changed the aux verb functions to take 'const std::string &' [npwoods]

-Refactoring/cleanup to state load/save handling [npwoods]
 * Changed running_machine::schedule_[load|save]() to take 'std::string &&' instead of 'const char *'
 * Changed running_machine::saveload_schedule to be 'enum class'

-New working machine added: Zone 60 (Jungle Soft / Ultimate Products (HK) Ltd) [RebeccaRGB]

-Hp9845: softkeys & video rendering improvements Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR introduces the handling of display softkeys in hp9845C & T emulation. It also improves the accuracy of the displayed
    image of these systems. Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-acommand: Use tilemap device [ajrhacker]

-via6522: fixed the flank timer value which improved  but not completely reverted the vectrex regression [JoakimLarsson]

-Minor improvement to CHD metadata loading Writing into an std::string is now legal with C++11 [npwoods]

-hh_tms1k.cpp fix typo Corrects spelling error [Dagarman]

-[Imgtool] Fix to MT#6576 Two independent issues reported under MT#6576 [npwoods]
 * The 'listformats' command was broken
 * imghd.cpp (the Imgtool <==> CHD HD bridge) was pretty much completely broken (more work is needed here)

-Fix 6800 invalid instructions length / Program counter behavior. Fix invalid instructions length. Each 6800 invalid opcodes have a
 different behavior. This commit fix the PC increment of each invalid opcode. There is three groups of invalid opcodes : [jfdelnero]
 * One byte invalid opcodes/instructions :
 * 00,02,03,04,05,12,13,15,18,1A,1C,1D,1E,1F,21, 38,3A,3C,3D,41,42,45,4B,4E,51,52,55,5B,5E
 * Two bytes invalid opcodes/instructions :
 * 61,62,65,6B,83,93,A3,C3,D3,DC,E3,EC,ED
 * Three bytes invalid opcodes/instructions :
 * 71,72,75,7B,B3,CC,CD,F3,FC,FD
 * Behavior checked from the Visual 6800 and the real hardware (goupil computer) http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/expert-6800.html
 * This patch make the goupil g1 Basic working.

-Remove starshp1 hack to restore correct behavior A very old (> 10 years?) hack seemed to clean up the way the ships explode in
 Atari Starship 1.  But this is different than the actual game behavior.  See this video of the way the ships behave when they are
 hit: https://youtu.be/-crXVuoKlL4?t=573  I'm pretty sure this is the way it used to work when I originally coded it from the
 schematics.  I have removed the hack and modified the comments in the code in video/starshp1.cpp [palazzol]

-z80scc: Reset Tx Interrupt Pending Command implemented Fix for the virtpool game [JoakimLarsson]

-EF9345 : Fix random mame crash while drawing characters at the right or bottom screen borders. [jfdelnero]

-Fixed an issue that could cause problems when loading reset_on_load devices (like cartridges) from softlists at runtime This was
 not guaranteed to cause a problem; the specific issue here was reported by mr_gw in the context of the CoCo, and the proximate
 issue (hanging) was in CoCo-specific code.   That said, this could cause problems elsewhere. [npwoods]
 * This was MT#6560

-[Imgtool] Cleanups to validity code, and transitioned to std::wcerr Windows doesn't like mixing std::wc[out|err] and printf()
 [npwoods]

-Visible area fixed. [jfdelnero]

-via6522 shifter support for external clock The regression of the Mac adb bus support caused me to refactor the shifter and I feel
 much better about this implementation as it got rid of ugly sub states and purely handles flanks now as opposed to a mix of flanks
 and cycles before. In my regression tests I noticed that some systems seems to work a bit better and of course both Mac adb bus and
 the Prodigy. Let me know any problems asap [JoakimLarsson]

-Overhaul to how MAME handles options This is an overhaul to how MAME handles options to provide a better foundation for what MAME
 is already doing in practice.  Previously, core_options was designed to provide an input/output facility for reading options from
 the command line and INI files.  However, the current needs (image/slot/get_default_card_software calculus and MewUI) go way beyond
 that. [npwoods]
 * Broadly, this PR makes the following changes:
 * core_options now has an extensibility mechanism, so one can register options that behave dramatically differently
 * With that foundation, emu_options now encapsulates all of the funky image/slot/get_default_card_software calculus that were
    previously handled by static methods in mameopts.cpp.  Changes to emu_options should not automatically cascade in such a way so
    that it stays in a consistent state
 * emu_options no longer provides direct access to the slot_options/image_options maps; there are simpler API functions that control
    these capabilities
 * Many core_options functions that expose internal data structures (e.g. - priority) that were only really needed because of
    previous (now obsolete) techniques have been removed.
 * core_options is now exception based (rather than dumping text to an std::string).  The burden is on the caller to catch these,
    and discern between warnings and errors as needed.
 * Obviously this is a risky change; that's why this is being submitted at the start of the dev cycle.

-Adding Doubutsu no Mori Card-e  (Series 1 and Series 2) [Shideravan]

-N64, RSP, drc : Wrap PC to 12 bits in a few more places. [Happy-yappH]

-Remove redundant DSWs These appear to have been overlooked & leftover from a a few years ago. Here is where I believe they were
 originally added. https://git.redump.net/mame/commit/?id=5ad309b60ffb645b9c438b04c61afaece1aa998f [Bad-A-Billy]
 * They are already included with the port_include so we don't need to add them again in the port_modify.

-Mechanism for devices to generate clocks for other devices The dynamic DERIVED_CLOCK part of this actually works on a similar
 principle to #2140, but reuses an existing member of device_t instead of adding two new ones. This does change configured_clock()
 to return an unresolved value for derived clocks, but nothing directly accesses that parameter outside of device_t anyway.
 [ajrhacker]
 * Foreseen applications of this include the ENT0 CLK instruction on MCS-48 microcontrollers.

-Update Taito Power JC and Taito Type-Zero descriptions [sjy96525]

-Added working controls for War : Final Assault and Road Burner [sjy96525]
 * I found the Working Control for War : Final Assault and Road Burner in the Controls TEST.

-DERIVED_CLOCK now updates in response to clock changes, and changed CoCo to use this mechanism [npwoods]
