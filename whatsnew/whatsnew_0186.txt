 * Started to break out common parts of Samsung ARM SoC devices.
 * Consolidated and de-duplicated forward declarations in src/emu, and removed some obsolete ones.

-Bug fix to -romident and aux verb cleanup (#2288) [npwoods]
 * Bug fix to -romident and aux verb cleanup
 * Made the following changes: 1.  Fixed a bug where resolved slot/image options would choke -romident (reproducible in MAME 0.185
    with 'mame64 -romident coco.zip') 2.  'mame64 -romident' no longer crashes (though it doesn't do anything useful) 3.  Changed
    the aux verb functions to take 'const std::string &'
 * Further cleanups to auxillary verb code, as per Vas
 * Specifically: 1.  The commands themselves now take 'const std::vector<std::string> &' for their argument lists 2.
    util::core_options now collects command arguments into a separate vector rather than treating them as unadorned arguments
 * Vas Crabb feedback
 * Now only using trim_spaces_and_quotes() when parsing INIs
 * Vas pointed out that it is inappropriate to trim spaces and quotes when parsing command line options

-Revert "Bug fix to -romident and aux verb cleanup (#2288)" [Vas Crabb]
 * This reverts commit 78bf804192f38d69fc9299dc7da724fb6a537f94.

-Bug fix to -romident and aux verb cleanup (take two) (#2299) [npwoods]
 * Resurrected auxverb_cleanup_and_romident_bugfix

 * Supporting auxverbs in any order
 * The previous patch was supporting 'mame64 -listsource pacman' but not 'mame64 pacman -listsource'

-Bug fix to -romident and aux verb cleanup (take two) Earlier I was handling 'mame64 -listsource pacman' but not 'mame64 pacman

-Adding hack to fish hashpath option out of INI files prior to softlist evaluation [Nathan Woods]
 * eientei95 reported an error where the hashpath specified in INI files was not being honored in softlist evaluation.  This is a
    change to preprocess INI files for the sole purpose of finding the hashpath prior to evaluating softlists.

-Fixed a regression in -listmedia/-listslots [Nathan Woods]
 * The issue is that -listmedia/-listslots were not honoring command line options specified on the slot.  This works around the

 * Do not update m_average_oversleep if we overslept too much. This is still a partial fix, more investigation is needed when the
    system time jumps backward.

-Relax the threshold to consider an oversleep as a system time change, in case of running on a heavily loaded system, as suggested
 by cuavas. [057a3dd61f99517a3afea0051a49cb27994f94d]

-ti99: Changes to peripheral handling [Michael Zapf]
 * Major rearrangement of the bus/ti99 subtree; using namespaces now.
   Moving all ti99 stuff from ti99x into the "internal" subtree.
 * Big all-in-one file gromport.cpp split into separate device files,
   introducing "gromport" as a bus of its own.
 * Added console connector "ioport" with PEB as slot option. PEB will now
   be plugged in, instead of being a subdevice; requiring update of slot
   options for emulation start of TI-99/4/4A/8. No changes to Geneve and
   TI-99/4P. ti99_4ev finds PEB plugged in as default, together with the EVPC
   so that we have a default video output.

-Fixed 2 bugs: [Robbbert]
 1. If either a multipart softlist item was loaded, or a single-part item loaded into a system with more than one of
 the same media slot, then a reset would cause a fatal error.
 2. If a non-existing image was listed in the ini, it would fatal error at start and there was no way to fix it except
 by hand-editing the ini file. This restores the previous behaviour of ejecting the bad image with the first error.

-Fix for a segfault when emulating HP9895 drive (take 2) Hi, this is the 2nd attempt to fix the bug that sometimes caused segfaults
 when emulating hp9895 drive. My previous attempt was in PR #2319. I think this addresses the problem better. It was due to a
 rounding error in floppy_image_device::find_position function that overflowed the "sacred" 2E+8 limit. Thanks. [fulivi]

-linenoise work Linenoise-ng uses convertutf.cpp which apparently has a dodgy license and Debian removes it in their build.  It also
 is overly complex.  I'm replacing it with a simpler port that has an MIT licensed UTF8 parser and moving more completion logic into
 lua enabling better completions.  Doing as a PR for suggestions and compile testing. [cracyc]

-via6522 shifter support for external clock The regression of the Mac adb bus support caused me to refactor the shifter and I feel
 much better about this implementation as it got rid of ugly sub states and purely handles flanks now as opposed to a mix of flanks
 and cycles before. In my regression tests I noticed that some systems seems to work a bit better and of course both Mac adb bus and
 the Prodigy. Let me know any problems asap [JoakimLarsson]

-Adding Doubutsu no Mori Card-e  (Series 1 and Series 2) [Shideravan]

-Mechanism for devices to generate clocks for other devices The dynamic DERIVED_CLOCK part of this actually works on a similar
 principle to #2140, but reuses an existing member of device_t instead of adding two new ones. This does change configured_clock()
 to return an unresolved value for derived clocks, but nothing directly accesses that parameter outside of device_t anyway.
 [ajrhacker]
 * Foreseen applications of this include the ENT0 CLK instruction on MCS-48 microcontrollers.

-DERIVED_CLOCK now updates in response to clock changes, and changed CoCo to use this mechanism [npwoods]
