Source Changes
--------------
-Improved Scanline Simulation [ImJezze]

 * changed the amount of scanline darkness, a setting of 1.0 now
    becomes fully black (to get the same result as before half your
    current setting)
 * scanline height now depends on the brightness of the underlying
    color
 * the amount of the scanline brightness and overdrive now depends on
    the scanline darkness
 * renamed 'Scanline Screen Height' to 'Scanline Screen Scale' and
    'Scanline Indiv. Height' to 'Scanline Height'
-Fixed Bloom Level Alignment
 * fixed target dimensions of bloom levels, which results in a much
    better alignment especially for game with very low resolution
    (therefore current bloom settings might look a little less intense
    than before)
 * small cleanups (nw)
-Quality and Performance improvements
 * HLSL now uses NPOT sized target surfaces (breaks compatibility with
    graphics cards based on R300/R400/NV30 and older)
 * HLSL target surfaces now have the size of the screen canvas
 * removed HLSL pre-scale factor
 * HLSL now uses a sharp bilinear interpolation to pre-scale textures
    to screen canvas size, based on [Themaister's] implementation
 * improved overall performance (based on the previously required
    pre-scale factor, you might notice a 5-50% speed-up depending on
    your graphics card, more if you used a higher pre-scale factor)
 * improved shadow mask quality (pixel-perfect) in screen-mode
 * fixed half source texel offset of bloom level alignment
 * removed ./hlsl/artwork_support folder
 * all shaders after pre-scale are now based on screen coordinate
    (workaground, till both raster and vector pass can work on texture
    coordinates)
 * disabled distortion shader for more than one screen and for
    artworks in full mode, does not affect artworks in copped mode
    (workaground, till both raster and vector pass can work on texture
    coordinates)
 * moved compute_texture_size() from texture_info to texture_manager
    (nw)

    unused
 * removed other unused register_texture() definition

    Advance (color LCD)

-ibm5170.xml: Added SICOS mouse driver and SICOS Paint. [Curt Coder]

-Super Poker: Added the missing PPI's 8255 and routed the involved
 inputs/outputs through them. 3super8 has PPi's initialization
 routines, but seems to be a leftover since it lacks of them. Also
 cleaned up the driver and added technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

-Added layout for Frankie Dettori's 7th Heaven [John Parker]

-Notetaker: hooked up more of the IOCPU I/O registers. Separated reset
 functions for IOCPU and EmulatorCPU. [Lord Nightmare]

 beeps on boot. Fixed several wrong polarity status bits. Documented
 where the framebuffer lives. Better documented the boot process.
 Hooked up the VSync Interrupt. [Lord Nightmare]

-Update Frankie Dettori layout to MAME 'dark' style [John Parker]

-svi318: initial version of driver rewrite [Dirk Best]

-NoteTaker: Hooked up screen framebuffer. Hacked the Odd/Even interrupt
 so screen drawing happens. [Lord Nightmare]

-NoteTaker: Fix another typo in bios 1.5, no longer runs off into the
 weeds and actually tries to load from floppy now. Needs FDC hooked up
 still. [Lord Nightmare]

-Add common debugger commands to global menu bar in OSX [Vas Crabb] 
 Also fix occasional crash in Copy Visible.  Note that copy
 visible, paste, toggle breakpoint, and view options still require you
 to use context menus in windows.  Debug/Run menus only work when a
 debugger window has focus, so Break is less useful than it could be.

-floppy: Fix subtle interaction between wd_fdc initial restore and floppy reset [O. Galibert] 

-IGS Super Poker: Decrypted all the US/UA sets. They are still not
 working due to hardware differences with the former ones laying in the

 devices. [Roberto Fresca]

-NoteTaker: Attached FDC and floppy drive. [Lord Nightmare]

-NoteTaker: Begin to hook up DiskReg register. [Lord Nightmare]

-Symbolics 3600: Fix ROM mapping, add a few more PLD/PLA/PAL labels.
 [Lord Nightmare]

 type attribute "Regular". This fix will load the first font found if
 no "bold" "bold italic" "italic" or "regular" attribute was found.
 [Couriersud]

 rawinput module, plus fixing some other defects in input modules as
 detected by coverity. [Brad Hughes]

-Added support for Raspberry Pi cross-compile [Miodrag Milanovic]

-pcat_dyn: add sound and mark toursol working [Carl]

-Symbolics 36xx: rename driver from s3600 to s3670 to better reflect
 the actual model of what we're trying to emulate. Added more memory
 maps from the patent, but these do not seem to match the 3670 exactly,
 more investigation is required. [Lord Nightmare]

    housemnq, housemn2, livegal, mcitylov, iemotom, ryuuha, kanatuen,
    kyuhito and idhimitu
 * Make analyser switch a toggle for many games

-corrected rom names in seganinj set [Mathieu Patard]
