-abc80: Converted to scanline based rendering, partially fixing hiresinv demo. [Curt Coder]

-abc80: Fixed flicker in hiresinv demo. [Curt Coder]

-abc80: Fixed graphics characters, hiresinv demo is now fully working. [Curt Coder]

-Fix natural keyboard mapping for vg9k keyboard (and hence UI paste/autoboot) Also fix key labels and make default mapping match
 physical layout where possible. This is a truly bizarre layout - the row between QWERTY and numbers is jammed in wherever it will
 fit. The "triangle" key isn't mapped, I don't know what it does or how to test it. [Vas Crabb]

-naomi.cpp: redumped "Noukone Puzzle Takoron (GDL-0042)" [rtw]

-Ambush: Driver state cleanups [Dirk Best]

-new Raiden 2 clone [briantro]

-Improve readability. Add more c++11 noexcept and  swap semantics. [couriersud]

-Softlist cleanup (#2075) [npwoods]
 * Eliminates the need for emu_options::update_cached_options() by providing a hook for when option values change
 * This is a preliminary fix to the issue identified in PR#2065
 * More softlist related refactoring:
   - We now only parse the command line (with core_options::parse_command_line()) once
   - Options that are set up during slot and image setup go through a 'value_specifier' function
   - Eliminated the command line postprocessing

-naomi.cpp: dumped "Ferrari F355 Challenge (deluxe, no link)" Export BIOS [Darksoft]

-Fixed an issue where device options (e.g. -cart) were reported as unknown when they actually worked [Nathan Woods]
 * This change also changes around how command line arguments are passed around; specifically I changed argc/argv to be
    std::vector<std::string>
 * Note this is not passed around 'const', the reason being that the command line processing will now "eat" the vector

-naomi.cpp: dumped "Ferrari F355 Challenge (deluxe, no link)" Japan BIOS [Ordyne, The Dumping Union]

-The recent softlist cleanup broke -console; this fixes it [Nathan Woods]
 * The reason is that the LUA console, HTTP server and other features relied on the command line arguments being "pre-parsed".  Part
    of the softlist cleanup was to sanitize where command line parsing occurs.  This change moves the setup of the LUA console (and
    other capabilities such as the HTTP server) to the correct place in the new order.

    mooncrst logic, so...)

-Fix Heathkit H-19 with Watzman ROM [Mark Garlanger]

-vicdual: simulate the gradient in nsub. [Ariane Fugmann]
 * figured out how the starfield and gradient get enabled on vicdual hardware. don't exactly know how they work yet, so I added a

-ti85.cpp: Convert TI-8x link port to a bus with emulated peripherals, should work with TI-82 and TI-85. [Vas Crabb]
 * tee allows two peripherals to be connected in parallel
 * glinkhle is an RS232 (9600 8N1) adaptor
 * bitsock sends raw assert/release line signals to/from a bitbanger device
 * monospkr is a speaker connected between tip/ring in parallel and sleeve
 * stereospkr is two speakers: left across tip and sleeve, right across ring and sleeve
 * Use glinkhle to make emulated calculators talk with cooked sockets, e.g.
 * mame ti82 -linkport glinkhle -linkport:glinkhle:rs232 null_modem -bitb socket.127.0.0.1:2345
 * Use bitsock to make emulated calculators talk with cooked sockets, e.g.
 * mame ti82 -linkport bitsock -bitb socket.127.0.0.1:2345
 * You can use tee to do stuff like listen to data activity for debugging purposes, e.g.
 * mame ti82 -linkport tee -linkport:tee:a stereospkr -linkport:tee:b glinkhle -linkport:tee:b:glinkhle:rs232 null_modem -bitb

-ibm5170 softlist: replace win31g floppy images with cleaned/fixed ones [Michael D]

-n64 - Add short delay between RDP full sync and DP interrupt [Happy]
 * Since the RDP is not currently scheduled for its own timeslices, this will allow the RSP interrupt from graphics tasks to arrive
    at the main CPU first.  In some instances, the RSP timeslice would end after the RDP had been sent the full sync command, but
    before the RSP could finish its task.  No issues were manifest if both RSP and RDP interrupts arrive at the same time, but it is
    still expected that the RSP interrupt should arrive first.

-RSP - let debugger disassembly windows track RSP PC [Happy]

-n64 - Flush RSP drc cache when SP DMA changes IMEM [Happy]

-naomi.cpp: dumped "House of the Dead 2" Japan BIOS [Nomax]

-triforce.cpp: security PIC dump for "Mario Kart Arcade GP" [Soyandroid]

-Preliminary attempt to fix regression caused by poor understanding of get_default_card_software() (#2122) [npwoods]
 * Tafoid brought to my attention a recent regression caused by my softlist changes.  Specifically, this failed:
 * mame odyssey2 -cart1 voice -cart2 bees
 * The reason is that the recent refactoring caused some critical softlist logic to be bypassed.  Essentially
    device_slot_interface::get_default_card_software() provides a technique for devices to inspect softlists and select slot options
    to be specified.  In the case above, the selection of the "voice" software list item in the first cartridge slot requires
    get_default_card_software() to be called to specify the o2_voice slot device, which in turn adds the second cartridge slot.
    Skipping this caused '-cart2' to stop being recognized.
 * This is an attempt to fix the problem.  In some ways, this doesn't go far enough - the astute observer will note that
    mame_options::reevaluate_slot_options() looks a lot like mame_options::update_slot_options(); part of me wants to just rip the
    latter out.  In the long run, device_slot_interface::get_default_card_software() should be reevaluated; having a hook is a good
    idea but it should be a pure function that doesn't alter state.

-bagman.cpp: Use 4-way joysticks in all games except squaitsa [AJR]

-ddungeon, darktowr, toffy, stoffy: Use 4-way joysticks [AJR]
 * Dangerous Dungeons, despite being a conversion of Double Dragon, has a manual that notes that 4-way joysticks should be used. It

-ti74: added Maths and Finance cartridges [PockEmul]

-[CoCo 3]  Fixed an issue clearing interrupts on the GIME implementation [Nathan Woods]
 * The normal way to acknowledge a GIME interrupt is by reading from $FF92/3.  However, the act of disabling interrupts by writing
    to the same registers will also do the trick, and we were not emulating this technique.
 * Thanks to Glen Hewlett and Tim Lindner for helping to identify this problem

-Greatly improve performance of -romident on multiple files [Vas Crabb]

-Fixed regression when loading multipart softlists [Nathan Woods]
 * Pernod found a regression introduced in the 0.183 softlist refactoring whereby multi-part softlist items would not distribute to
    multiple slots.  The problem was that the old code was relying on the image slots being loaded into the core.  This is not the
    way the new system works, so I've added a hook into software_list_device::find_mountable_image() that allows the new approach to
    work.

-Remove incomplete support for SuperSet H19. [Mark Garlanger]

-Incremental C++-ification of 6821pia.cpp [Nathan Woods]

-Improvements to 9845C light pen emulation Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR is for an improvement of the light pen emulation of 9845C system. The LP now behaves a lot better than before even though
    there are still some (minor) problems here and there. Hopefully I'll fix them in the (near) future.
 * Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-i386/pc_vga: save state fixes [moralrecordings]
 * VGA card now saves vga.dac to the state, as the MAME palette is clobbered periodically with data from here. Changed the type of
    vga.dac.colour to a flat uint8_t array seeing as save_item isn't struct-friendly. Fixes Liero.
 * Saved more VGA flags, including vga.miscellaneous_output, which despite the vague name is needed for reading from the ports.
 * Fixed an enum range check miss.
 * Saved more i386 flags required for 32-bit save states. Fixes Jump 'n Bump.

-vic1001_cass.xml and c64_cass.xml dumps added speakeasy software to support PPP speakeasy hardware
 https://www.sendspace.com/file/52xvix [Dagarman]

-Last minute corrections _These need to be critically merged before the new MAME version. This includes some important fixes in the
 nes softlist that repair some of the crap jobs I did on a lack of sleep, doing some big, big whoopsies with me removing WRAM
 defines by accident that prevented a few educational titles from booting or working correctly._ [kazblox]
 * Misc changes: Fixed copyrights on pirate.cpp code in subor.cpp, and a few more alternate names/serials and publishers were added
    as well to some educational carts on the NES softlist.
 * Some BWRAM defines were replaced with WRAM defines due to the said carts in this commit not actually needing battery-backed WRAM
    to function. They will peform just fine with plain WRAM since none of them have any save functions, nor their iNES dumps
    describe any battery extensions whatsoever.

-Incremental C++-ification of 6821pia.cpp 1.  Changed some 'int' ==> 'bool' where appropriate 2.  Changed the various control byte
 macros to static functions [npwoods]

-Additions/improvements to nes driver and softlist Almost every change should be logged in the whole text of the commit. [kazblox]
 * If anything needs cleanups before the new MAME version, let me know. Due to sleep deprivation, I will have to send the new
    softlist dumps to the code email in the morning.

-[CoCo 3]  Fixed an issue clearing interrupts on the GIME implementation The normal way to acknowledge a GIME interrupt is by
 reading from $FF92/3.  However, the act of disabling interrupts by writing to the same registers will also do the trick, and we
 were not emulating this technique. [npwoods]
 * Thanks to Glen Hewlett and Tim Lindner for helping to identify this problem

-z80sio: interrupt support for upd7201 and i8274 Things are more correct for the SIO in general and the 7201/8274 in particular.
 [JoakimLarsson]
 * This made it possible to replace a workaround in the isbc2861 driver which now robustly boots Xenix. Previously this failed due
    to a lost interrupt with an infinite hang as a result. The fix included implementation of triggering a iack by reading the rr2
    register which could then replace the m1_r() call. Also the 8274 interrupt is now handled solely by the 8259.

-Fixed regression when loading multipart softlists Pernod found a regression introduced in the 0.183 softlist refactoring whereby
 multi-part softlist items would not distribute to multiple slots.  The problem was that the old code was relying on the image slots
 being loaded into the core.  This is not the way the new system works, so I've added a hook into
 software_list_device::find_mountable_image() that allows the new approach to work. [npwoods]

-Confirm a few japanese dump and add a new one. Hello, [evadot]

 * No changes to externally registered vblank delegates or screen update methods

-pc_vga/cs4031: fix save state support The pc_vga driver contains a lot of registers for the current state that weren't really being
 saved. The three original lines are a facsimile of the raw VGA memory that gets updated in lock step with the easier-to-use
 attribute registers, but it is the registers which track the state and are used for all the logic. Patch makes VGA games survive a
 save state load. [moralrecordings]
 * Also, the CS4031 chipset driver has three registers for tracking the excerable A20 line bodge, and only two were being saved.
    Software using extended memory would frequently get the whole memory map ripped out from under it. Fixed by tracking the third
    register.

-feversoc: Add coin hopper output (prize hopper doesn't quite work) [ajrhacker]

-Adds a new addrmap.cpp validation intended to catch AM_REGION declarations not tied to anything meaningful [npwoods]

-Preliminary attempt to fix regression caused by poor understanding of get_default_card_software() Tafoid brought to my attention a
 recent regression caused by my softlist changes.  Specifically, this failed: [npwoods]
 * mame odyssey2 -cart1 voice -cart2 bees
 * The reason is that the recent refactoring caused some critical softlist logic to be bypassed.  Essentially
    device_slot_interface::get_default_card_software() provides a technique for devices to inspect softlists and select slot options
    to be specified.  In the case above, the selection of the "voice" software list item in the first cartridge slot requires
    get_default_card_software() to be called to specify the o2_voice slot device, which in turn adds the second cartridge slot.
    Skipping this caused '-cart2' to stop being recognized.
 * This is an attempt to fix the problem.  In some ways, this doesn't go far enough - the astute observer will note that
    mame_options::reevaluate_slot_options() looks a lot like mame_options::update_slot_options(); part of me wants to just rip the
    latter out.  In the long run, device_slot_interface::get_default_card_software() should be reevaluated; having a hook is a good
    idea but it should be a pure function that doesn't alter state.

-Softlist additions and corrections [kazblox]
 * nes: added Magic Kid GooGoo, named as mkgoogoo
 * nes: assigned UxROM to dancekar

-HP9845C driver Hi, [fulivi]
 * this hefty set of commits implements the HP-9845C driver. This system was the color version of the 9845 range of machines. The
    driver was written together with Ansgar Kueckes who did a lot of reverse engineering of the video and lightpen sub-systems.
 * The best way to try the emulator is running the DEMO tape. Quick instructions:
 * Load the colorgfx optional ROM (-rom1 colorgfx)
 * Load the demo1.hti into cassette drive (-magt demo1.hti)
 * Optionally, enable lightpen emulation (-lightgun -lightgun_device mouse)
 * Map the k8..k15 keys, they are not mapped by default and they are needed for menu navigation (see below).
 * Start the demo with: LOAD "AUTOST",1 <EXECUTE>
 * Be patient, demo takes a while to load..
 * Once the system asks for the type of printer paper, load the demo2.hti image and answer the question (see next point)
 * Use the 8 softkeys to navigate the menus. At the moment softkeys are not directly emulated but you can use the keyboard
    substitutes (SK1-8 map to SHIFT + K8-15 respectively)
 * Enjoy!
 * I'm mailing all the necessary ROM & tape images to the usual "code" e-mail. Beside this major change, this set of commits also
    fixes a subtle bug in nanoprocessor emulation.
 * Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-Revert "ie15: convert to a device with frontends (standalone driver and rs232…" Reverts mamedev/mame#2096 [cuavas]

-Fix Super19 version of Heath H19. Adds the AM_MIRROR settings which the Super19 ROM relied on.  The CRTC ports and the videoram
 memory were the only ones I saw, which was REQUIRED to get it working, but figured I'd update all the memory and ports to properly
 reflect the real board in case the ROM used it in other code paths I hadn't tested. [mgarlanger]
 * Also added preliminary definitions for the SuperSet ROM, not sure if the current AM_MIRROR options allows a way to properly
    define how it is configured. My initial attempts to define it, caused run-time crashes. The ROM chip is a 32K chip, of which 16K
    is used. But the valid data is in the 2nd and 4th 8K blocks of the chip, not the 1st and 3rd. So it would either error with
    'mirror touching a set bit' or have the memory reflect the invalid parts of the ROM chip.

-Fixed regression pertaining to specification of empty strings as slot names e.g. - 'next -scsibus:1 "" -listdevices' [npwoods]

-vicdual: nsub gradient I figured out how the starfield / gradient get enabled on vicdual hardware. [SailorSat]
 * N-Sub uses a gradient for the background; there are black destroyers on the horizon that basically can't be seen without.
 * N-Sub and Star Raker also seem to have some kind of starfield simulation which is completly missing for now.
 * Can't find any decent schematics for the hardware, so the gradient is based on guesswork for now.
 * Reference for N-Sub: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqq4ZKyh3UA
 * (older) simuation (column based) seemed off at the water surface - http://images.arianchen.de/mame/nsub/0003.png
 * (current) simulation (pixel based) is better, but still not perfect -  http://images.arianchen.de/mame/nsub/0004.png

-Fix Heathkit H-19 with Watzman ROM [mgarlanger]

-Cleanups to satisfy cuavas's OCD And one miscellaneous commit to go along with them: [kazblox]
 * made rockclim base off mooncrst in galaxold.cpp (Z80 sound code was stolen from that game and MAME code suggests that the video
    board uses some mooncrst logic, so...)

-Fix softwarelist cart memory cheats Moved the initial cheat file loading to later in the start up process after the software list
 cart_rom has been loaded. Otherwise it will not load the cheats as the cart_rom will not exist. Eg. mame coleco qbert [PugsyMAME]

-iNES Mapper 190 support, miscellanous cleanups in some drivers This pull adds the following changes: [kazblox]
 * add iNES Mapper 190 for Magic Kid Googoo support!
 * make ladybugg use galaxian driver instead of galaxold
 * make mooncrst configuration in galaxold driver actually use mooncrst_audio
 * made the mooncrst-based games in galaxold driver actually derive off mooncrst
 * correct the XTAL in marineb and derivatives to 12MHz as seen in this photo:
    http://www.andysarcade.net/store2/images/source/PCBimages/AA01263P.jpg
 * correct the Konami sound XTAL definition in galaxian.cpp
 * other misc. XTAL definition cleanups
 * for now, make spcwarp use hunchbkg palette ROMs

-The recent softlist cleanup broke -console; this fixes it The reason is that the LUA console, HTTP server and other features relied
 on the command line arguments being "pre-parsed".  Part of the softlist cleanup was to sanitize where command line parsing occurs.
 This change moves the setup of the LUA console (and other capabilities such as the HTTP server) to the correct place in the new
 order. [npwoods]

-Fixed an issue where device options (e.g. -cart) were reported as unknown when they actually worked This change also changes around
 how command line arguments are passed around; specifically I changed argc/argv to be std::vector<std::string> [npwoods]
 * Note this is not passed around 'const', the reason being that the command line processing will now "eat" the vector

-Softlist cleanup This is an attempt to greatly refactor softlists, prompted by MT bug 6464 and the concerns raised in #2065.
 [npwoods]
 * I've done a lot of work to pull the evaluation of softlists at the command line upfront and then the results are used to drive
    the slot and image setup process.  I've also had to refactor slot and image setup, on the idea that
    core_options::parse_command_line() should only be called once and arguments needed when setting up slots and images should go
    through a module that can interpret both the command line and softlist processing results.
 * This is a very gutsy refactoring.  It is inevitable that this introduces at least some regressions due to the brittle nature of
    the softlist code, and my incomplete awareness of all of the capabilities of softlists.

-Update exp.h Removed colon (":") from image_interface value that was preventing some front-ends, such as QMC2, from being able to
 launch ColecoVision software from the software list (the software rom itself ended up being omitted so it just booted the main
 bios, like starting a real CV without a game inserted.) [gordon-fish]

-Fix Heath H19 keyboard Fixes the problems with the keyboard in the H19 terminal. Now the numeric keys and their symbols display
 properly with and without the shift key. The NS MM5740 keyboard encoder and keyboard ROM is now being used instead of the "generic
 keyboard". Other minor fixes, including the fixing the BELL.  Seems like the H19 is in a state, that the MACHINE_NOT_WORKING flag
 can be removed, if there is disagreement on that, I can add it back in. [mgarlanger]
