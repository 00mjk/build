7880: Decoupling RPK logic from TI-99 cartridge code [npwoods]
We desire to use the RPK cartridge format for CoCo cartridges.  The first step is to decouple the existing RPK logic from TI-99

8456: formats, osd, util: Started refactoring file I/O stuff. [cuavas]
This cleans some more C legacy:
* Input recording/playback on big-Endian targets should be fixed.  Previously, byte order was swapped on read but not on write.
* The `io_generic` structure from libformats was effectively a vtable implemented in C.  This has been replaced with a real C++
  interface, with proper error reporting.  Semantics are similar to POSIX read/write and pread/pwrite.  Several implementations are
  provided in libutils for various use cases across the codebase.
* The ZIP/7zip `archive_file` implementations have been extended to allow an arbitrary random read/write object to be opened as an
  archive.  As a demonstration of this capability, the TI-99 computer family can now mount RPK cartridges from inside archives.
* The `osd_file`, `core_file`, `archive_file`, `chd_file` and `device_image_interface` classes have been refactored to use
  `std::error_condition` rather than their own individual enumerated types for results.  This allows proper error propagation across
  layers, more specific error messages, and extensibility.
* The zlib compression features were moved out of `core_file` into filter classes for more flexibility and better encapsulation.
* The TD0 format handler was refactored to not rely on the layout of the `floppy_image_legacy` structure.
* Helper templates for testing class/function attributes were changed to `std::integral_constant` aliases in cases where they don’t
  need to be specialised.  If we’re lucky, this may marginally improve build time.
This does highlight a few issues:
* Error reporting for `core_file` still isn’t great, and the class tries to do too much.
* The `io_generic` interface swallowed errors altogether, so the format handlers are all written as though I/O errors don’t exist.
* The wrapper functions for using `io_generic` would fill unwritten parts of the underlying storage if you were to seek past the end
  and then write.  This is now implemented using adapter classes.  I dislike this, much as I dislike the complete lack of error
  checking.  However, getting rid of this would require checking all the format handlers to ensure they don’t actually depend on it,
  and fixing them if they do.
* Besides format handlers not checking for errors, `device_image_interface` doesn’t make it easy to do a cautious save by writing a
  new file with a temporary name and replacing the existing file on success.  Even if the format handler reports an error, the user
  will be left with a corrupted file.
* The error checking/reporting on input record/playback isn’t very good.
* CHD errors aren’t reported to the user very well.
* There are still plenty of other things that want overly specific interfaces, or have poor error handling.
The bulk of this change, particularly in terms of affected files, is just porting to new interfaces.  I didn’t test all the format
  handlers, but the ones I did test all worked.  I didn’t test `imgtool` much.

8470: upd7220: don't run wdat if figd figure type is set and set the pattern in wdat [cracyc]
This fixes the pc-test from https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/57e4628edcda9ae3bec250e4cb2a1887affb2cc8#commitcomment-54427020 .
  I did some regression testing but @brijohn probably has more things to test.

8475: Major state refactoring of pc98 based HW [angelosa]
This is a first major step in splitting up machine classes in NEC PC98 family tree.
Highlights:
* Splits up derivative HWs into own state machine and files (pc98ha.cpp, pc9821.cpp and pc9801_epson.cpp);
* Adds a preliminary uPD4991a parallel RTC, used by pc98ha;
* Fix -26, -86, -118 C-bus sound board dips or jumper settings;
* Fix default sound card for pc9821 (-86) and pc9821ce2 / pc9821cx3 (-118);
* Adds preliminary MAD Factory Otomichan-kai C-bus sound board;
* Adds boilerplate code for C-bus installing board I/Os, avoiding the possible inconvenience of board(s) getting silently unmapped
  by other installed boards;
* Major refactoring of HW dip switches readouts, using required_ioports instead of scattering things around in PPI hooks;
* Extensive QA rundown, including research on missing features and undumped machines.
 
Addresses the following bugs:
* Don't passthrough mouse irq frequency when cycle setting is setup too, fixes jastrike mouse input on options menu;
* Fix kanji RAM window LR readback, makes telenetm to properly display 8x16 chars on RS and derivative machines;

8504: fixed one-shot paddle timers in Apple II and clones [xotmatrix]
This fix reproduces some usually undesirable behavior with the game I/O port. The way an Apple II analog input (joystick or paddle)
  works is the potentiometer in the controller becomes part of a 555-style monostable timer circuit on the motherboard (the actual
  chip is a 558 quad timer). A timer start running when the game port is strobed. The more resistance supplied by a potentiometer,
  the longer a timer runs. When a timer expires, its output is asserted. By continuously polling an output in software, the elapsed
  time is measured, yielding a controller position.
There are a couple of subtleties to this circuit. First, when a timer is started, it cannot be restarted until it expires. Second,
  all of the timers use a common strobe signal. If you want to read a two-axis joystick this can get you into trouble.
Typically, for each axis, you strobe the game I/O port (PTRIG) and then you poll an output (PADDL0,X) until it asserts itself (or
  the routine times out). That's what this Apple II ROM code does:
```
fb1e: ad 70 c0     PREAD       lda     PTRIG
fb21: a0 00                    ldy     #$00
fb23: ea                       nop
fb24: ea                       nop
fb25: bd 64 c0     PREAD2      lda     PADDL0,x
fb28: 10 04                    bpl     RTS2D
fb2a: c8                       iny
fb2b: d0 f8                    bne     PREAD2
fb2d: 88                       dey
fb2e: 60           RTS2D       rts
```
The problem happens when you go to read the next axis. If the resistance of the first axis is less than the resistance of the second
  axis, the second timer may still be running from when it was strobed for the first axis. A second strobe will have no effect and
  the timer will appear to expire prematurely, giving the wrong result. BASIC is slow enough this is never an issue but it can be a
  pain in the neck for machine language programmers.
MAME's Apple II drivers always restart the timers when strobed. That means a controller is read perfectly every time. It is not
  sufficiently broken and the "fix" is to not restart a timer if it is already running. I'm unaware of any software that exploits
  this glitch but reproducing it improves emulation accuracy.
See _Apple IIe Tech Note #6: The Apple II Paddle Circuits_ for a more thorough discussion of this anomaly.

A note about Agat-7 and Agat-9 clones: I do not have access to this hardware but I spent a couple of hours reverse engineering PCBs
  from photos. I believe they use an equivalent circuit implemented with a pair of 1006BИ1 timer chips (the Soviet equivalent of an
  NE555). It also appears to me from looking at several motherboards and reading some documentation that these machines only support
  two paddles. The MAME driver supports four like a regular Apple II. I fixed the timers but I have not removed two extra inputs.
  I'll leave that so someone more knowledgeable of the machines and the emulation code. I was unable to load BASIC into the Agat-7
  to run the demonstration code. I tried it in another Agat-7 emulator and it runs with some modification (PREAD is at a different
  location in firmware).

8575: -util/delegate.cpp: One less level of indirection for functoid delegates. [cuavas]
If a delegate is set to a functoid (e.g. a lambda) with a signature that is an exact match for the delegate's signature, it will be
  bound directly.  If arguments or the return value need conversion, a static adaptor will be generated.  This removes unnecessary
  indirection through the out-of-line `std::function::operator()`.
There’s no flexibility lost, you can still be a bit sloppy with lambda signatures, but it means if you’re strict with your lambda
  signatures, one small performance penalty is removed.  You still have an extra level of indirection through the captured `this`
  pointer when accessing members, but that’s not as bad as the flow control indirection.

8589: util/delegate.cpp: Fixed multiple issues [cuavas]
* Fixed `this` pointer displacement being reapplied after delegates are copied – caused issues with classes with multiple
  inheritance.  Each time you assigned or copied a delegate containing a member function pointer with a non-zero `this` pointer
  displacement, the `this` pointer would walk into the weeds a bit more.  This did not affect “compatible” delegates, only the
  optimised versions.
* Made null member function pointer test conformant with Itanium C++ ABI specification.  The specification only requires that the
  pointer be a null function pointer for the “standard” variant, or that the pointer be a null function pointer and the least
  significant bit of the `this` pointer displacement be clear.  Previously, the pointer and entire `this` pointer displacement were
  being compared to zero.  This only affected the “internal” implementation.
* Corrected size of this pointer displacement – fixes issues on big Endian targets.  The `this` pointer displacement was being
  interpreted as an `int` rather than a `ptrdiff_t`.  This is not immediately obvious on little Endian platforms, because in
  practice, the value is never too large for the range of an `int`, and the least significant part of the value will be used.
  However, on big Endian platforms, the most significant part of the value will be used, so it would always appear to be zero or
  negative one on big Endian targets with 32-bit `int` and 64-bit `ptrdiff_t` (e.g. PPC64, AArch64 or MIPS64 in big Endian mode).
  This only affected the “internal” implementation.
* Fixed function addresses for virtual member functions on targets where function pointers point to descriptors (e.g. Linux PPC64,
  or Itanium).  On these platforms, vtables contain function descriptors, so you obtain a canonical function pointer just by adding
  the offset to the vptr.  This only affected the “internal” implementation.
* Applied shift to `this` pointer displacement for targets that use the ARM variant of the Itanium ABI.  On these platforms, the
  `this` pointer displacement is shifted left by one bit position to make space for the virtual function flag bit and must be
  arithmetically shifted to the right by one bit position before being applied to compensate.  This only affected the “internal”
  implementation.
* Fixed `this` pointer displacement not being applied for virtual member functions on targets using ARM variant of the Itanium ABI.
  The `this` pointer displacement must be applied before fetching the vptr on these platforms.  Previously it was not applied to the
  `this` pointer at all for virtual member functions.  This only affected the “internal” implementation.
* Fixed `this` pointer displacement being incorrectly applied to the vptr on targets using the ARM variant of the Itanium ABI.  The
  `this` pointer displacement was being erroneously applied to the vptr when obtaining a virtual member function address.  This only
  affected the “internal” implementation.
* Renamed the “internal” implementation to “Itanium” as it works with two variants of the Itanium C++ ABI.
* Added support for “unknown inheritance” pointers in MSVC implementation.  This allows delegates to work when MSVC is invoked with
  the `/vmg` option.
* Renamed most macros to have a `MAME_DELEGATE_` prefix for crude namespacing, and made less code conditionally compiled.  All the
  member function pointer wrappers are now compiled all the time, and the appropriate one is selected with a type alias.  This makes
  it easier to catch errors without needing to recompile for multiple targets.

(this fixes choplifter since it flips screen pages by writing DLISTH to change the display list)
also adds draw_scanline8 calls to render artifact colors in modes 2,3, and 15
Choplifter seems to swap it's double buffer pages by having two display lists, one at 2000 and another at 2100.  When it wants to
  flip pages, it just writes DLISTH and also modifies the shadow display list registers.  Before this fix, it would modify both
  m_doffs and m_dpage on a write to DLISTH.
Also, if you selected Artifact Colors ON in the configuration, the display would stop updating when modes 2,3 and 15 were on.

-dariusu: add continue price dipswitch vigilant: swap punch/kick buttons to match with arcade cabinet [hap]

-Decoupled RPK logic from TI-99 cartridge code. (#7880) [npwoods]
 * Decoupled support for RPK (RomPacK cartridge images) from TI-99 code, enabling the logic to be leveraged by other drivers.

-ui: Made zoom controls a bit more intuitive. [Vas Crabb]
 * The UI controls are described as zoom in/out, but they had the opposite effect on the palette and tile viewers.  That has been
    changed to make them consistent with the tilemap viewer.
 * Made the default zoom key not act as a toggle.  People are familiar with the function of Ctrl+0/=/- in web browsers, so making
    them behave similarly in MAME should make it more approachable.  Also added the default zoom key to the relevant documentation
    page.
 * Implemented the default zoom key for the palette and tile viewers.
 * In the tilemap viewer, if the view is in default expand to fit mode, zoom in/out starting from the actual zoom ratio.  Once
    again, this behaves more like the zoom controls in a web browser displaying an image so it should be more intuitive.
 * Made more messages from the tilemap viewer localisable.

-util/zippath.cpp: Fixed MT08074. [Vas Crabb]
 * There were multiple issues at play here.  After #8443 was applied, is_root was simply never returning true on Windows, as
    OSD_WINDOWS isn't actually defined outside libosd and libocore.  This caused phantom parent items to appear in disk roots on
    Windows, but it meant that the check in zippath_resolve would always fail so the trailing backslash would be trimmed.  Fixing
    the macro test in is_root meant the trailing backslash from C:\ would no longer be trimmed, which caused the stat in
    zippath_resolve to fail.

-bigbord2.cpp: Hooked up floppy DRQ that had somehow got lost. [Vas Crabb]

-Reduced tag map lookups in several drivers and devices. [Vas Crabb]

-util/coretmpl.h: Removed an overload of bitswap that can be avoided using if constexpr. [Vas Crabb]

-Added doxygen comments to some classes, and fixed several doxygen warnings. [Vas Crabb]

-util, osd: Test for _WIN32 rather than WIN32. [Vas Crabb]
 * In C++17 mode, WIN32 is no longer a predefined macro, although various things in 3rdparty define it to maintain legacy support.
    We're better off moving forward anyway for when WIN32 disappears entirely.  (WIN32 is not a reserved name, while _WIN32 is,
    starting with an underscore follwed by an uppercase letter.)

-tx0.cpp: Add preliminary software list for both systems [AJR]

    inheritance.
 * Made null member function pointer test conformant with Itanium C++ ABI specification.
 * Corrected size of this pointer displacement - fixes issues on big Endian targets.
 * Fixed function addresses for virtual member functions on targets that use function descriptors (e.g. PPC64).
 * Applied shift to this pointer displacement for targets that use the ARM variant of the Itanium ABI.
 * Fixed this pointer displacement not being applied for virtual member functions on targets using ARM variant of the Itanium ABI.
 * Fixed this pointer displacement being incorrectly applied to vptr on targets using ARM variant of the Itanium ABI.
 * Made less code conditionally compiled to make it easier to catch errors.

-Update samcoupe_flop.xml [ArcadeShadow]

-merits.cpp: Correctly identified set as "Pub Time Darts II" (#8595) [ClawGrip]

-sharrier: Hook up MCU, remove simulation (#8552) [Dirk Best]
 * The MCU for the sharrier1 set is handcrafted and marked BAD_DUMP
 * There is a slight issue with the initial synchronisation, so there is a hack to ignore the problematic write

-util/delegate.h: Try to catch issues earlier, and some cleanup. [Vas Crabb]
 * Optimised generation of late bind helper functions.  The late bind helper function doesn't depend on the delegate signature -
    only on the late bind base class and function target class.  Having it inside the delegate base class means it needs to be
    instantiated for every combination of late bind base class, function target class and delegate signature.  In a typical driver
    file, there is only one late bind base class (delegate_late_bind), and there will be delegates with multiple signatures bound to
    function members of the same class (e.g. read and write handlers, possibly of different widths, bound to members of the driver
    state class).  By moving the late bind helper out of the delegate base class, the number of required instantiations can be
    reduced.  By moving the body out of the enclosing class declaration, the compiler can be encouraged to coalese instantiations
    across translation units.  While this won't give a further reduction in compile time, it should at least reduce the output
    binary size by reducing duplication for devices that frequently have handlers installed in memory maps.
 * Added an additional template parameter to delegates allowing the late bind base class to be changed if desired.
 * Moved the MSVC implementation "this" pointer optimisation out-of-line and added logging.  Also cleaned up the Itanium "this"
    pointer adjustment and code pointer resolution implementation to reduce duplication and conditional compilation.
 * Made binding_type_exception give a more meaningful what() message than "std::exception".
 * Added extensive validity tests for delegate functionality.  Pointers to member functions are tested, including multiple
    inheritance, virtual and non-virtual member functions, and checking for generational loss across copying/assigning delegates.
    This should properly exercise "this" pointer adjustment for the Itanium and MSVC implementations, and vtable lookup for the
    Itanium implementation.  So-called late binding functionality is tested, including exceptions on failure.  Functoids are tested,
    although given the encapsulation it's not possible to check that an apator isn't generated when it shouldn't be.

-wndrplnt: Decapped and dumped MCU [Alex, Brian A. Troha, TeamEurope]
 * Also remove simulation, clean ups

-cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Proof-of-concept for optimisation of calling out. [Vas Crabb]
 * Resolve address space virtual member function addresses on constrcution and call them directly.  Provides a small but measurable
    improvement to performance in drivers that use the recompiler and access the memory system a lot.
 * Also made MSVC delegates capable of walking past all the thunks MSVC puts in the way of actually calling a member function.  I'm
    not accounting for the "this" pointer being passed in RDX when the return value is an oversize scalar.  This is harmless because
    it won't see anything that looks like a virtual call thunk using RCX when RCX points to uninitialised space for the return
    value.  It just means virtual member function calls won't be bypassed if the return value is an oversize scalar, but that
    doesn't happen frequently anyway.

-util/delegate.h: Make comparison operators more technically correct. [Vas Crabb]
 * For Itanium ABI, two null member function pointers should compare equal even if the undefined bits differ.
 * For MSVC ABI, there's all sorts of complexity around what happens when you compare pointers to member functions for different
    inheritance types.
 * You'll still occasionally get weird results comparing pointers to members of different classes.

-util/delegate.cpp: Recognise a couple more MSVC thunks. [Vas Crabb]
 * The MSVC C++ ABI doesn't reserve the first vtable entry for classes without a virtual destructor, so the instruction to load the
    virtual member function address may not need an immediate displacement.
 * Also recognise virtual member function call thunks for AArch64.

 * At some point I'll make a proper header ABI detection.  There's too much stuff to keep in the delegate sources, and it will be
    useful for other stuff like recompilers.

-util/delegate.h: Use "compatible" delegates for MinGW GCC i686. [Vas Crabb]
 * The Itanium delegate has questionable value on on MinGW i686 as it injects a conditional branch in the hot path for delegates
    anyway to deal with the different __thiscall convention.  It's somehow breaking and causing memory corruption in full builds,
    but I don't have the time to work out exactly which delegate type is the problematic one, especially not with a release coming
    soon.
 * This will probably cause 32-bit MinGW builds to become substantially larger.
