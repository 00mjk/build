 * nltool now accepts -Ddefine=value to pass on to netlists
 * improved option handling and added "dummy" options to add grouping
    and examples in help output.

    capacitor modelling instead of delay devices. Really slow, but
    very useful to calibrate timings.

 * Weverything -Werror -Wno-old-style-cast -Wno-padded
    -Wno-weak-vtables

 * Wno-c++98-compat-pedantic -Wno-exit-time-destructors
 * Wno-format-nonliteral -Wno-weak-template-vtables This was a helpful
    exercise since it brought forward some serious issues with
