-konendev: hooked up H8/3007 "IFU" CPU [R. Belmont]

-netlist: MAJOR bug fix. Expect other bugs to surface. [Couriersud]
 * This commit fixes an issue with parsing netlists. To cut a long story short: The separation of nets into independant groups of
    nets failed under some circumstances for four terminal devices (controlled voltage/current devices). Everything worked as long
    as an external feedback loop existed. Without external feedback loop, the separation would either fail or create "false"
    separated nets. This fix also highlighted an issue with cmos switches (4066/4016).
 * There is a slight chance that other bugs may surface due to this change.

-netlist: add current controlled voltage source (CCVS). [Couriersud]

-netlist: Fix/extend SPICE format conversion. [Couriersud]

-wd177x_dsk: generalize to allow custom track format variations [68bit]
 * Add a get_track_format() method that can be overridden to supply format variations for any track and head. The code is
    generalised to account for such variations. The default method returns the passed format, so this change is neutral for existing
    formats.
 * Simplify the FLEX DSK format code. There are now simply format variation descriptions for the second track that have the sector
    ID continuing in sequence from the first track, rather than specialized code.
 * Extend the FLEX format to support variations in the sectors ID of the first two sectors. The FLEX 6800 boot sectors have IDs
    based at zero rather than one. Extend the FLEX format to support variations for which the first track, on both sides, is single
    density on an otherwise double density disk which was historically a common format.
 * Extend the OS9 disk format to support variations for which the first track, on only the first side, is single density on an
    otherwise double density disk. OS9 for the SWTPC and Gimix typically used such formats.
 * Extend the OS9 disk format to support variations with a base sector ID of zero in contrast to the existing COCO OS9 format which
    uses a based sector ID of one. The OS9 format identification code is extended to rely on the optional information stored in the
    OS9 LSN0 header to identify COCO format disks, and all COCO format disks appear to have this optional information in a regular
    enough format.

-xavix2: First stab at the cpu [O. Galibert, N. Gilbert]

-SS50 DC5 FDC: OS9 support, misc corrections. [68bit]
 * Add the OS9, MFI and UniFlex floppy formats. Update the debug config options to suit OS9. Single density track zero on OS9 is
    typically only on the first side, unlike FLEX which used single density track zero on both sides. Clarify some of the FLEX
    specific debug options. Fix some bugs in the logic related to these options.

-Gimix: improve IRQs, OS9 improvements, four floppies, [68bit]
 * The FDC clock changes with the programmed connector selection.
 * The 5.25 versus 8 inch boot floppy jumper is an input and does not need and input changed handler.
 * The FDC supports four floppy drives, up from two.
 * The IRQ line was not implement. Add an input merge device and connect up more of the IRQs to this. The timer hack is no longer
    necessary and has been removed - it was just missing an IRQ.
 * Add a DASM override for OS9 system calls, copied largely from the COCO, enabled only when the OS9 ROMs are switched on.
 * Add a BIOS option for OS9 Level 1 version 1.2. Renamed the version 1.1 ROMs for consistency.
 * The Gimix machine appears to be working well enough to promote it from a 'skeleton' to working.

-Alfaskop 4110 keyboard and related improvements I have backed out of trying to support the PLA for the moment due to lack of time.
 I will come back to it later however but has run out of steam for the moment due to both the revert setback and that the driving
 project at Dalby datormuseum in fact got hold of the missing parts and can now boot the 4110 terminal for real and is in no need
 for an emulated communication processor. Good news is that all the software parts has been preserved so we can do it through
 emulation for real now, we lacked the IPL:s for some of the systems and would have had to hack our way through those.

-c64_cass.xml: Add new dumps. Dumped by myself. [FakeShemp]

-Plug & Play work [DavidHaywood]

-swtpc09: OS9 support, misc fixes. The ROM for this one is available at http://www.evenson-consulting.com/swtpc/Downloads.htm in the
 'Complete Setup current version' bundle and within that see the file `ROMImages/6809/OS9Rom.stx` which needs to be decoded into a
 flat EPROM binary. There are also OS9 boot disks there etc. The decoded ROM in a zip file for MAME is temporarily at
 https://68bit.org/swtpc09o.zip [68bit]
 * The OS9 ROM has been set up as a system BIOS as these are specific to each version of OS9, the ROM contains part of OS9, so other
    variants are expected. This ROM boots straight into OS9. Here is just one example: ```mame64d swtpc09o -io1:dc5:fdc:0 qd -flop1
    /tmp/OS9BTBK3.DSK```

-flex_dsk: include an identify() method. It is necessary to return a higher score on success, higher than returned by the default
 method, in order for a general 'identify' to succeed over competitive matches. [68bit]

-n64.xml: Document a few more N64 game PCBs [FakeShemp]

-Update n64.xml Fixed two errors in my previous commit. [FakeShemp]

-Gimix: improve IRQs, OS9 improvements, four floppies, The FDC clock changes with the programmed connector selection. [68bit]
 * The 5.25 versus 8 inch boot floppy jumper is an input and does not need and input changed handler.
 * The FDC supports four floppy drives, up from two.
 * The IRQ line was not implement. Add an input merge device and connect up more of the IRQs to this. The timer hack is no longer
    necessary and has been removed - it was just missing an IRQ.
 * Add a DASM override for OS9 system calls, copied largely from the COCO, enabled only when the OS9 ROMs are switched on.
 * Add a BIOS option for OS9 Level 1 version 1.2. Renamed the version 1.1 ROMs for consistency.
 * The Gimix machine appears to be working well enough to promote it from a 'skeleton' to working.
 * Found the OS9 L1 V1.2 ROMs and a boot disk at https://www.roug.org/retrocomputing/os/os9/gmx If anyone knows of more Gimix OS9
    software then it might be possible to push this emulator OS9 support further - there are some interesting documented features,
    hard disk support, a hardware CRC card, intelligent serial ports, 64k user space usable in OS9 Level 2, etc

-SS50 DC5 FDC: OS9 support, misc corrections. Add the OS9, MFI and UniFlex floppy formats. Update the debug config options to suit
 OS9. Single density track zero on OS9 is typically only on the first side, unlike FLEX which used single density track zero on both
 sides. Clarify some of the FLEX specific debug options. Fix some bugs in the logic related to these options. [68bit]

 vgmplay.cpp : Fix YMF278B volume [cam900]

-vgmplay.cpp : Fix YMF262 handling [cam900]

-wd177x_dsk: generalize to allow custom track format variations Add a get_track_format() method that can be overridden to supply
 format variations for any track and head. The code is generalised to account for such variations. The default method returns the
 passed format, so this change is neutral for existing formats. [68bit]
 * Simplify the FLEX DSK format code. There are now simply format variation descriptions for the second track that have the sector
    ID continuing in sequence from the first track, rather than specialized code.
 * Extend the FLEX format to support variations in the sectors ID of the first two sectors. The FLEX 6800 boot sectors have IDs
    based at zero rather than one. Extend the FLEX format to support variations for which the first track, on both sides, is single
    density on an otherwise double density disk which was historically a common format.
 * Extend the OS9 disk format to support variations for which the first track, on only the first side, is single density on an
    otherwise double density disk. OS9 for the SWTPC and Gimix typically used such formats.
 * Extend the OS9 disk format to support variations with a base sector ID of zero in contrast to the existing COCO OS9 format which
    uses a based sector ID of one. The OS9 format identification code is extended to rely on the optional information stored in the
    OS9 LSN0 header to identify COCO format disks, and all COCO format disks appear to have this optional information in a regular
    enough format.
 * The FLEX and OS9 improvements are bundled in to show the use case for this change to wd177x_dsk, and to give some examples. It
    appears likely that some other formats could be simplified to leverage these changes. The approach to extending wd177x_dsk is
    intended to minimize the changes to other users of that code, and they require no change. Perhaps another pass over this code
    might abstract it differently, but could we see if this change lands without breaking anything as a first step.
 * It has been tested on a good range of OS9 disks, COCO, Dragon, Nitros9, SWTPC, Gimix. PRs for the SWTPC OS9 support and fixes for
    Gimix will follow. The FLEX disk improvements have been tested on SWTPC and Gimix.
