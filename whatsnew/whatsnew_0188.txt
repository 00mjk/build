 * Corrected flicker RAM size, removed NVRAM, and connected playfield lamps and operator adjustments.
 * Added save state support.

-Layout system improvements: [Vas Crabb]
 * Made scripts do substantial validation of layouts at build time.
 * Drop views that don't validate at runtime rather than entire layouts to help machines with terminals connected by default.

-Cleaned up serial, matrix keyboard and TI-8x link protocol interfaces: [Vas Crabb]
 * Switched to delegate timers and moved state registration to post-start, making implementations a bit less error-prone.

-Made device_memory_interface own its address space objects. [Vas Crabb]

-Made parent/clone loops raise a fatal error rather than hanging in a loop appending to a string. [Vas Crabb]

-Cleaned up Gaelco protection MCU interface device. [Vas Crabb]

-Fixed default dipswitch settings for Parodius [Jack Li]

-Reintroduced a state save menu, take two (#2358) [npwoods]
 * This turns the current state save feature to a menu; one can still press 0-9, but you can also browse a menu when loading and
    saving state
 * Fixed some issues requested by Vas Crabb
 * Updated state menu to support arbitrary character slots
 * WIP, transitioned 'entry_char' to std::string
 * Still need to address Joystick and FR keyboard concerns
 * Reimplemented state save support with joystick buttons
 * Changed the state menu to be "code driven" rather than "character driven"
 * When the menu is displayed, it will look at the filenames, and translate them to a visual representation as per the user's locale
 * Vas feedback

-Overhaul to how MAME handles options, take two (#2341) [npwoods]

-Fix sound_sdl::sdl_callback, fill buffer with silence when underflow. [057a3dd61f99517a3afea0051a49cb27994f94d]
 * The problem is most noticeable when you are saving state, and the save takes a relatively long time, short period of audio gets
    played repeatedly, which is usually unpleasant.
 * I found out it's caused by sdl_sound::sdl_callback not fill the audio buffer with silence when underflow occurs. According to
    https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_AudioSpec, if there's nothing to play, the callback should fill the buffer with silence.
 * I tested this change and the problem is gone.

-Made the debugger 'load' length field be optional, C++-ification [Nathan Woods]

-ti99: Changed Hexbus chaining [Michael Zapf]

-Added samples to PT Reach Mahjong [Lord Nightmare, Angelo Salese]

-Fixed issue #2413, caused by options regression [Nathan Woods]

-Fixed issue loading reset_on_load() images (#2414) [Nathan Woods]

-Fixed state save menu UI issues (#2411) [Nathan Woods]

-Fixed issue #2420 [Nathan Woods]

-ygv608.cpp: added CRTC function, moved irqs in handler callbacks [Angelo Salese]

 * cbuster.cpp: Add a x3 hack to the YM2203 clock frequency to fix incorrect pitch [Phil Bennett]

-tehkanwcd has a different dipswitch setup to the other sets (different locations populated on PCB?) so fix it in MAME so the
 dipswitch reading works also hook up diplocations etc. for all sets in driver. [David Haywood]
 * I think maybe this driver also needs some kind of PPI devices? not sure which tho.

-socrates: reimplemented keyboard mcu hle as a separate timer-driven function, fixing issues with super painter and a few other
 games not recognizing keyboard input. Got rid of anonymous timers. Got rid of keyboard tagmap lookups. Added savestate support.
 [Lord Nightmare [Lord-Nightmare]

-arkanoid.cpp: added machine def for "akranoid bootleg with 68705p3 mcu and ay-3-8910" for the ark1ball bootleg, so it has "properly
 wrong" sound. Added some notes about bootleg roms and what sets they are copied from or derived from. Updated note about hidden
 credits with hiscore initials. [Lord Nightmare]

-Fixed sorcerer unmount issue reported by Robert [Nathan Woods]
 * Report from Robert:
 * Start mame sorcerer, then enter the slots menu, empty the rs232 slot, then choose Reset. It crashes with an access violation.

-identified dipswitches for a number of decocass sets (#2425) [David Haywood]

-r9751: Add initial SMIOC device (#2423) [Brandon Munger]

-dectalk.cpp: removed unnecessary driver init and replaced with machine_start [Lord Nightmare]

-dectalk.cpp: nuked anonymous timers, added savestate support [Lord Nightmare]

-kinst.cpp: updated hardware info [Guru]

 * reworked initiator transfer information state machine: should now support all scsi phases
 * improved handling of dma/non-dma commands
 * added an undocumented hack to make InterPro work

-yg608.cpp: added border color [Angelo Salese]
 * (Yes, it makes the POST screens to be black and not green)

-match updated 5390 device [Patrick Mackinlay]

-sdl: Add SDL_WINDOW_BORDERLESS for fullscreen, required by some window managers on linux [O. Galibert]
 * Breakage was in 8338e0d7a490c8d33f924b55582223e70015c195 (march 2015), and yes, fullscreen didn't work correctly for me since
    then.  Shows how much I use it, I guess.  FWTW my window manage is the venerable fvwm2.  CourierSud, if you happen to remember
    why you changed that (in the middle of a lot of other changes), let me know, and we'll see how to make it work for everybody.

-dvdisasm: Simplify by decoupling information creation and display rendering [O. Galibert]

-debugcpu: Eliminate direct() from read_opcode [O. Galibert]

-options: Set the value when setting the default as before [O. Galibert]

-hh_sm510: added background vector graphics to gnw_ml102 [ChoccyHobNob]

-inherit memory map [Patrick Mackinlay]

-ncr5390: Improve [P. Mackinlay]
 * improved initiator transfer information logic
 * split transfer count/counter
 * added rudimentary 53c90a/53c94 support
 * reworked initiator transfer information state machine: should now support all scsi phases
 * improved handling of dma/non-dma commands
 * added an undocumented hack to make InterPro work
 * match updated 5390 device
 * inherit memory map
 * implemented interrupt status flag in status register for 53c90a, this is critical for InterPro

-plugins/cheat: link simple cheats [cracyc]

-stv.cpp: corrected Taiwan BIOS label [cpsystem3]

-abcheck: add default EEPROM so the game boots w/o going into service mode first. [Guru, R. Belmont]

-split decocass class up so that the dongle types aren't polluting main class (#2429) [David Haywood]
 * split decocass class up so that the dongle types aren't polluting main class, emulate bootleg multigame, change accidental?
    drawing order change that was made a while back and broke several games

-sun1: replace console hack with upd7201 device [Sergey Svishchev]

-Improve the speed of romident by dynamically allocating some large device member arrays at device_start time instead [Phil Bennett]

-Rename AS_DECRYPTED_OPCODES to AS_OPCODES [O. Galibert]

-dimemory: Lift the cap on the number of address spaces per device [O. Galibert]

-fix 06613, game sets rowscroll to be bigger than assumed size of tilemap [David Haywood]

-m62 proposed cleanups. [David Haywood]
 * I've split the massive PROM blocks up into something more modern looking (the single PROM region with all PROMs crammed into it
    is an old MAME thing from when only one PROM region was allowed)  I've also made use of multipe palettes and gfxdecode
    structures (required using rgb32 to draw to)
 * As the boards are quite modular this seems to make sense to me, the palette for the sprites and the sprite decode + sprite
    palette decode is the same across all games while the rest of the hardware changes a bit.  This should allow us to step closer
    to converting the various boards into devices and piecing them together more logically.

-hh_sm510: improved gnw_mw56 SVG screen and added background graphics [hap, ChoccyHobNob, Tanukichi]

-shootaw2: added dumped EEPROM image [Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

 * improved 5390 device, removed legacy scsi stuff

-megasys1.cpp: Add information regarding R&T (Rod-Land Prototype) [Ryou]

-decrypted SEGA_315_5133 used by 'seganinja' set, promoted it to working [David Haywood]
 * it's the exact same code revision as the other sets, just for a different encrypted CPU, so not actually that interesting.

-Updated Fedora instructions [Brian King]
 * DNF is now preferred package manager. alsa-lib-devel is also required (not mentioned in the current docs)

-segas16b.cpp: Replace goldnaxe2 317-0122 i8751 bad dump with working redump from undamaged chip. Remove MCU HLE code.
 [anonymous, digshadow]

-output: Fleshed out network output provider so it has the same capability as legacy Win32. [arbee]
 * Clients:
 * Connect to TCP port 8000
 * Messages will be of the form "verb = value\1"; if your client is busy when MAME is spamming, you may get multiple messages glued
    together by \1 separators.  (\1 was chosen because it's neutral on Win32/Mac/Linux).
 * You will get a "hello = 1" message upon connection to MAME, and a "mamerun = 0" message when MAME shuts down.
 * You may send "send_id = n" to MAME to get IDs where n=0 means ROM set name of current game, 1-? = output node names
 * MAME will reply "req_id = string\1"; this is currently the only case where a string will be returned instead of an integer value.
 * A working example POSIX client will be released soon.

-create c-chip device with correct CPU type in it and a bunch of notes (pinout etc.) create a uPD78C11 derived CPU type for this

 [David Haywood]

-blackt96.cpp: various changes/fixes [Angelo Salese]
 * Added flip screen & coin counter support;
 * Rewritten text layer to tilemap;

-A number of DS5002FP chips were dumped using the method published by Morten Shearman Kirkegaard and Peter Wilhelmsen as documented
 at (#2484) [David Haywood]
 * http://www.afdelingp.dk/files/articles/ds5002fp/ds5002fp.pdf
 * namely Touch and Go, World Rally 2, and TH Strikes Back
 * a 2nd verification pass is still needed on them from additional boards, as bad bits existed in World Rally 2 even prior to
    extraction (steering logic was broken but bad byte was identified and fixed as the code for that command handler was identical
    to World Rally 1) and TH Strikes Back is crashing at the first boss (could also be a CPU core issue)  Glass was also dumped, but
    at the time the data wasn't extracted, only the code, and the board has since died, so needs redoing.

-68340SIM: Added 8 bit ports A and B, updated LOG system [Joakim Larsson Edstrom]

-[MC6847] Fixed the "Semigraphics 6" mode on the CoCo/MC-10 [Nathan Woods]
 * On these systems, the "Semigraphics 6" mode (contrary to most literature) will display "stripes" for video bytes from $00-$7F.
    This is because the INTEXT pin on the MC6847 VDG is set, but AS is not and there is no external ROM.

-hp85: improved CRT access timing, implemented hw timers and beeper [fulivi]

-missb2: Fix oki read/write bitswap so what seem to be the correct sound effects are played. Used the bublpong oki rom in place of
 the badly dumped missb2 oki rom due to all non-corrupted areas being identical, so they're most likely supposed to be the same, but
 marked it as BAD_DUMP until redump. Add watchdog (same as parent bublbobl hardware has). [Lord Nightmare]

-Standardize button layout for PCE bootlegs [Angelo Salese]

-gaelco / ds5002fp changes: [David Haywood]
 * made ds5002fp store internal ram and sfr registers to nvram as they're battery backed
 * this includes the 'configuration' details which are actually programmable, so don't belong in the 'MACHINE_CONFIG' section but
    rather as part of the default NVRAM
 * as the exact format of the NVRAM storage is not known, and as not to break compatibility with the 'wrally' set Gaelco offer these
    bytes are now configured in the ROM LOADING like default NVRAM.  Slightly awkward, but probably the best way.
 * made the SRAM (external to DS5002FP, but still powered by the same battery) also save content, some games actually use it to
    store scores etc. as well as the game code.
 * cleaned up the Touch and Go Dallas dump, and added some preconfigured internal RAM so that it actually loads the score data from
    the SRAM properly
 * prepared all other drivers for the adding of the SRAM dumps, removing old 'never going to work' simulation code in the process.
    To do this a wrapper / interface device for the Gaelco Dallas + SRAM box was created.
 * out of whatsnew Alligator Hunt was dumped and works, but not yet added, want to verify on a 2nd PCB first as the process does
    corrupt some bytes and a couple had to be handfixed, so the only way to know for sure is multiple dumps.

-gameboy: fix SGB VRAM transfers (#2504) [Tauwasser]
 * gameboy.xml: remove misleading comment
 * Sachen 4B-003 was recently added
 * Signed-off-by: Tauwasser <tauwasser@tauwasser.eu>
 * gameboy: fix Super Game Boy VRAM transfer
 * A basic implementation of VRAM transfer. It fixes a number of games and removes the SGB border hack. However, it's very likely
    that the bahvior is much more complex. The old implementation was good enough for the majority of games, so this should suffice
    until such time when SGB is implemented on top of SNES.
 * The attribute data was resized to 4096 bytes, so a whole VRAM transfer can take place even though only 4050 bytes are used. The
    idea is that the whole 4096 bytes are _probably_ transferred to WRAM and a game might theoretically upload a small executable
    and use that data. However, running native SNES code is currently unsupported anyway.
 * Signed-off-by: Tauwasser <tauwasser@tauwasser.eu>
 * gameboy: various code style/comment fixes
   - return GB_MBC_NONE instead of magic 0 value
   - add MLT_REQ case in sgb code and mention where it's actually handled

-Improved wheel board on flagstaff and vegas That leader lamp bit makes me question the purpose of that "valid" bit as they are in
 every write on the vegas wheelboard, but I wouldn't know how to go about testing that. Added a layout for sf2049 as well. There is
 something on lamp4, but I can't identify it. [Risugami]

-Fixed default dipswitch settings for Parodius The arcade operator's manual lists the default extend setting as 30000/100000 rather
 than 20000/80000. [jackrjli]

-gameboy: fix SGB VRAM transfers I noticed that there was an ugly SGB border hack in the Game Boy system. I looked at it and
 realized that the SGB VRAM transfer method was broken (even though it works for most games due to Nintendo's SGB SDK). [Tauwasser]
 * The SGB VRAM transfer is actually done through the display signals, so the contents have to be shown on screen. It's not really
    known if window and bg scroll take/attributes take effect or not, so somebody with actual hardware might need to investigate
    further. If that's the case, a possible redesign would be to make the PPU render to a frame buffer and use that frame for VRAM
    access and final rendering, but that would entail a big change and it's unclear if it wouldn't be easier to actually emulate the
    SGB on a SNES with a GB slot.
 * Anyway, the actual transfers work now as expected and the hack for certain games (Donkey Kong 2 and 3 amongst others) are gone.

-SDA5708 layout for dbox This works enough to give some output improving the driver. Right now the driver hangs right after putting
 the BIOS version on the display and I have a film of the real hardware what texts should be put there when it works correctly so it
 is useful. [JoakimLarsson]
 * Ideally one would like the sda5708 device to offer a sub-layout element to the dbox driver layout to place on the right spot of
    the dbox-1 front. Maybe there is a way to do that I don't know about.

 * testing for 82586 and 82596 big endian and non-linear modes
 * more complete statistics capturing
 * 82596 monitor mode
 * throttle timers and diagnostic command
 * special case handling for different 82596 steppings in big endian mode

 * correct Great Baseball (Euro, USA, Bra) release year (title screen as reference).
 * correct Teddy Boy Blues (Jpn, Ep-MyCard, Prototype) interface type.

-Improve WD2010 emulation Better feedback on cylinder positions. Most checks contained in winchester test suite pass now (option 16
 at  RX50DIAG.TD0 diskette), except subtest #4 - and few low level tests that require specially crafted manufacturer tracks (write
 test #1). Historical annotation: manufacturer info was hidden in last 4, 8 or 16 cylinders of a DEC RD5x hard disk, diagnostic area
 in the 4, 8 or 16 cylinders before, depending on the number of heads. At least manufacturer tracks used a format inaccessible to
 standard disk routines and thus were not writeable. [Bavarese]

-Cleaned up the MC-10 driver [npwoods]

-Export additional functions for Emscripten builds This patch adds some additional static member functions and exports them to allow
 control of the running system via a Javascript API in the web builds.  Example: [jbaicoianu]
 * ```js JSMESS.save('statename'); JSMESS.load('statename'); JSMESS.soft_reset(); JSMESS.hard_reset(); JSMESS.exit(); ```

-Gameboy v8 Miscellaneous Game Boy changes. Please use fast-forward merge to preserve the commit comments. [Tauwasser]
 * Fixes an issue with a previous pull request where I forgot one MBC1 collection game.
 * Fixes an issue with MMM01 emulation of ROMB0 switching (broken select ROM bank 0x00 at 0x4000-0x7FFF; not visible due to games
    behaving themselves)
 * add Sachen 4B-003 that was dumped a little while ago to xml

-Add dipswitches to tsukande Backup Memory set to Clear otherwise it keeps complaining of bad backup RAM [einstein95]

-fccpu1: newer version of firmware added, Force Debugger v1.1 [JoakimLarsson]

-Fix save/load states in Emscripten build Slightly rearranges the ```running_machine::run()``` function so that the Emscripten build
 can share the same codepath, allowing it to access the scheduler to process any save/load commands that may have been queued.
 [jbaicoianu]

-use Caps0ff dump for srdarwin use Caps0ff dump for srdarwin handcraft MCU rom for srdarwinj like was done for other games in the
 driver so the old sim can be killed off, marked as BAD_DUMP seems stable, although I had to boost the interleave. [DavidHaywood]
 * NOTE, this game has never been emulated correctly - there was the following comment
 * -------- The table below is hopefully correct thanks to Jose Miguel Morales Farreras, but Boss #6 is uncomfirmed as correct.
 * if (m_i8751_value == 0x8000) m_i8751_return = 0xf580 +  0; /* Boss #1: Snake + Bees */ if (m_i8751_value == 0x8001)
    m_i8751_return = 0xf580 + 30; /* Boss #2: 4 Corners */ if (m_i8751_value == 0x8002) m_i8751_return = 0xf580 + 26; /* Boss #3:
    Clock */ if (m_i8751_value == 0x8003) m_i8751_return = 0xf580 +  2; /* Boss #4: Pyramid */ if (m_i8751_value == 0x8004)
    m_i8751_return = 0xf580 +  6; /* Boss #5: Snake + Head Combo */ if (m_i8751_value == 0x8005) m_i8751_return = 0xf580 + 24; /*
    Boss #6: LED Panels */ if (m_i8751_value == 0x8006) m_i8751_return = 0xf580 + 28; /* Boss #7: Dragon */ if (m_i8751_value ==
    0x8007) m_i8751_return = 0xf580 + 32; /* Boss #8: Teleport */ if (m_i8751_value == 0x8008) m_i8751_return = 0xf580 + 38; /* Boss
    #9: Octopus (Pincer) */ if (m_i8751_value == 0x8009) m_i8751_return = 0xf580 + 40; /* Boss #10: Bird */ if (m_i8751_value ==
    0x800a) m_i8751_return = 0xf580 + 42; /* End Game(bad address?) */
 * ----------
 * The value for Boss 6 was actually incorrect, the boss is meant to have 2 states, it was starting in the 2nd, skipping the first
    entirely; this even caused priority errors on the boss.  With the real MCU values the boss works as it should.

-mc14411 and fccpu1 improvements [JoakimLarsson]

-Corrected ITT3030 70 track drive type and added 35 track ... drive type and for… drive type and format definition. [helwie44 and
 rfka01] This change reflects the originally available drive types and will allow easier data exchange with machines from the same
 design company (SKS): alphatronic P1, P2, P3, P4, sks nano and others. [rfka01]

-interpro: serial dma is working Serial DMA is the main change, now the driver gets a "Booting system" message during operating
 system rebuild (but hangs soon after). Also: [pmackinlay]
 * switch to ncr53c94 (older models use 53c90a, newer use 53c94)
 * initial Ethernet preparation
 * timer-based DMA (per discussion with @galibert, to be optimised later)
 * some C++'ifying fixes to the disassembler

-ncr5390: tcounter and dma/drq changes Several changes here that fixes the DRQ/DMA/fifo behaviour for subsequent changes to InterPro
 that rely on DRQ to trigger DMA transfers., please check my hacking carefully @galibert. [pmackinlay]
 * Specifically:
 * ncr5390: corrected tcounter and transfer count zero handling, count/zero should be based on transfers to/from SCSI bus, and not
    to/from DMA
 * ncr5390: prevent fifo over/underrun, requires restarting state machine from dma_r()/dma_w()
 * ncr5390: corrected bus/function complete with fifo - interrupt should occur only when it empties, but state is detected based on
    SCSI bus
 * ncr5390: clear status, istatus and sequence when reading istatus (not status) with active interrupt
 * ncr5390: tweak DRQ behaviour, only assert if there is insufficient data in fifo
 * nscsi_hd: correction to INQUIRY command when a non-zero LUN is requested
 * Again, appreciate anyone who can test with Sun4 or NeXT and let me know if I've broken anything new.

-New device: MC14411 Bit Rate Generator [JoakimLarsson]

-Added available Commodore PC10-III ROM dumps The guys over at the German vintage computer forum have collected the PC10-III system
 BIOS versions in one thread. http://forum.classic-computing.de/index.php?page=Thread&postID=119037#post119037 [rfka01]
 * I've added the version 4.36b and added the roms for those which were marked "NO DUMP" until now.

-Begin of HP80 emulation Hi, [fulivi]
 * this commit is the start of my work on emulating the HP80 series computers. There are already a couple of stand-alone emulators
    for this series around, but none in MAME. This is WIP, so there are a lot of things that are not emulated yet. What works:
 * HP85A machine with 16K of RAM
 * Capricorn CPU works
 * Keyboard works (with minor issues)
 * CRT text / graphics modes work (correct speed is not emulated yet so service ROM complaints)
 * BASIC is usable
 * What is missing (and I'll have hopefully working soon):
 * HW timers
 * Beeper
 * Integral printer
 * DC100 cassette drive
 * Extension ROMs
 * I/O modules (especially the HPIB interface so that we can hook up floppy drives)
 * Other models in the family (e.g. HP86)
 * Just a quick BASIC program to test: ``` 10 FOR I=1 TO 10 @ DISP TAB(I);"Hello MAME!" @ NEXT I 20 END ```
 * @ is used in this variant of BASIC to separate statements on the same line (what would be a colon in other BASICs).
 * I'm sending the relevant ROM images to the usual MAME email address.
 * Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-load some recent Caps0ff MCU dumps, not hooked up for now. (+ load cchip dumps) [DavidHaywood]

-Add an external panel for the Ensoniq VFX family of keyboards ... with a websocket interface and an HTML/Javascript implementation
 that can be served over HTTP. [cbrunschen]
 * This was previously proposed with a different HTTP & Websocket server; in this pull request, the functionality has been ported un
    top of the web & websocket server that is exposed through the http_manager.

-Include -output option in documentation Include -output and it's available options in documentation. [OzFalcon]

-z80scc: basic wait/dma request support I've done the absolute minimum necessary to get serial DMA working for the InterPro.
 [pmackinlay]
 * This involved implementing some unimplemented logic around the SCC "wait/dma request" behaviour on transmit. I have not attempted
    to tackle either the "wait function" or receive, so this is partial at best. It's also possible that there are some other points
    where the transmit buffer can be filled/emptied and the new check_waitrequest() function needs to be called.
 * Appreciate a review from those with more detailed understanding of the SCC device, but it's working for me at the moment and I
    think there are few side-effects.

-misc cchip prep + notes create c-chip device with correct CPU type in it and a bunch of notes (pinout etc.) create a uPD78C11
 derived CPU type for this purpose, with internal ROM map use internal ROM map for other uPD78C10 chips as it's always present. add
 missing NO_DUMP definitions to various games using C-Chips with correct size etc. pump megablast through the device code as really
 all it ever does is bank the c-chip window and test the RAM. [DavidHaywood]

-Updated Fedora instructions DNF is now preferred package manager. alsa-lib-devel is also required (not mentioned in the current
 docs) [inflatador]

-decrypted SEGA_315_5133 used by 'seganinja' set, promoted it to working [David Haywood] it's the exact same code revision as the
 other sets, just for a different encrypted CPU, so not actually that interesting. [DavidHaywood]

-interpro: scsi is working [pmackinlay]
 * removed legacy 539x device support
 * improved dma
 * scsi is working with modified 5390
 * all ioga diagnostics pass (with hacks)
 * stubbed eth registers

-m62 proposed cleanups. I've split the massive PROM blocks up into something more modern looking (the single PROM region with all
 PROMs crammed into it is an old MAME thing from when only one PROM region was allowed)  I've also made use of multipe palettes and
 gfxdecode structures (required using rgb32 to draw to) [DavidHaywood]
 * As the boards are quite modular this seems to make sense to me, the palette for the sprites and the sprite decode + sprite
    palette decode is the same across all games while the rest of the hardware changes a bit.  This should allow us to step closer
    to converting the various boards into devices and piecing them together more logically.

-fix 06613, game sets rowscroll to be bigger than assumed size of tilemap [DavidHaywood]

-sun1: replace console hack with upd7201 device [shattered]

-split decocass class up so that the dongle types aren't polluting main class also emulate bootleg multigame, change accidental?
 drawing order change that was made a while back and broke several games [DavidHaywood]

-ncr5390 changes - for review only, don't commit With some help from OG yesterday, I've made some important changes to the "transfer
 information" logic in ncr5390. In theory, this will help Sun4 (it should now handle all phases), hopefully won't break NeXT, and my
 emerging InterPro is happy with it now. [pmackinlay]
 * In more detail, the things I've modified are:
 * split transfer count/counter (count is latched and used to reset the counter when DMA commands start, while the counter is
    read-only and tracks the actual transfers)
 * added rudimentary 53c90a/53c94 support (although the extra registers are essentially ignored for now)
 * reworked initiator transfer information state machine: should now support all SCSI phases
 * improved handling of DMA/non-DMA commands
 * added an undocumented hack to make InterPro work (i.e. setting the sequence to non-zero after a message accept)
 * This PR is a placeholder for smarter people to comment before I commit this; I don't have the inputs necessary to test NeXT/Sun4
    and don't want to break them. Also, I'm tampering with a fairly complex bit of code and I'd prefer if at least Olivier takes a
    good look first.

-Fixed sorcerer unmount issue reported by Robert Report from Robert: [npwoods]

This is only half done but it is a good branch point where I will implement the LED display both using a small video display and in
  a separate branch using the layout system to compare performance [JoakimLarsson]
Anyway there are work on the 68340 too and the Dbox now can display some ascii art characters using the LOG macro printouts proving
  the sda5708 hookup is somewhat correct [JoakimLarsson]


New working clones
------------------
not sure if its really clone, might be different game which uses gfx and music same as pktet346 set [MetalliC]
(presumably different locations populated on PCB, test mode indicates as such) [DavidHaywood]
without this demo sound dipswitch etc. isn't mapped properly. [DavidHaywood]
also hook up diplocations etc. for all sets in driver. [DavidHaywood]
I think maybe this driver also needs some kind of PPI devices? not sure which tho. [DavidHaywood]


New machines marked as NOT_WORKING

ibm5150: Boulder Dash Construction Kit [Justin Kerk]
Doraemon - Nobita no Dorabian Night (Tourvision PCE bootleg) [system11, The Dumping Union]
This is a MIDI sound module, but this skeleton driver does not have anything like that included as the CPU (H8/520) is not emulated.
  [superctr]
Sound chip is Yamaha YMW258-F. This is almost certainly identical to the MultiPCM chip used in the Sega arcade boards. 12-bit
  samples are used, which are not supported by the current multipcm.cpp core, but is supported by the OPL4 (ymf278b.cpp) which uses
  a similar sample format. [superctr]
