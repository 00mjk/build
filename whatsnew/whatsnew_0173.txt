 picture, and noted that the Japan set we have is revision 2, but a
 revision 0 exists, undumped [Lord Nightmare]

-TMS5220: add a 'combined rs/ws write' function for systems which
 require both pins to change at exactly the same time and not to reset
 the chip. [Lord Nightmare]

-Revert software-installed slot/image options when changing software [AJR] 
 Remove emu.h's stealth include of emuopts.h through mconfig.h;
 reduce dependency on emuopts.h in other headers and source files.
 MCFG_CPU_FORCE_NO_DRC is now a CPU configuration parameter rather than
 a global one; it still works to override the -drc option setting.

-fix some missing gfx in bbusters / mechatt [dink]

-Make overscan on integer scaled targets optional (add option -intoverscan). [Calamity]

-luaengine: direct and region accessors [Carl]

-This one documents what I think is a real bug of the Japanese game
 Sports Pad Soccer: part of the player 2 input is read from player 1
 input instead. The patch also reorganizes code of the Japanese Sports
 Pad controller device and replace some PORT_CUSTOM/PORT_CHANGED
 callbacks with PORT_READ_LINE/PORT_WRITE_LINE. [Enik]

-Add experimental cheat lua plugin [Carl]

-Improvements to tape driver of hp9845b [F.Ulivi]

-info.cpp: Improved documentation of input devices in the listxml
 output, since having just a generic 'number of buttons' is rather
 pointless in the context of home systems with configurable controllers
 (being them keyboards, keypads or joypads). Now the various
 controllers are listed separately with the number of buttons they
 have. Frontend authors who relied on the "buttons" attribute of the
 input node for any kind of filter shall now scan all available
 controllers and take the maximum among their "buttons" attribute
 (possibly discarding keyboards and keypads if they want) to recover
 the old value. [Fabio Priuli]

-info.cpp: Started to acknowledge PORT_16WAY inputs in -lx, since they
 were reported as 8-ways so far. [Fabio Priuli]

-Devfind revision phase 1, cleaning out some legacy stuff [AJR]
 * Eliminate the cached device_t::m_region pointer and its region()
    getter method. Devices that need to bind to a region with the same
    tag should use optional/required_memory_region or
    optional/required_region_ptr with DEVICE_SELF as the subtag; this
    improves error checking. (DEVICE_SELF has been moved to device.h
    for greater visibility in the source.)
 * Allow required/optional_region_ptr to specify a specific length
    which must match that of the region found.
 * Implement finder_base::finder_tag() getter for diagnostic purposes.
 * Perform some (not very efficient) validity checks on memory region
    finders instead of allowing them to automatically pass.
 * Privatize device_memory_interface::m_addrspace.

-Magic 10 driver: Added technical notes and a missing PLD dump. [f205v]

-Added m62(kidniki) to nl.lua. Started some experiments around parallel
 solving of linear equations. This code is not active. Fix kidniki
 audio performance. [Couriersud]

-plugins/timer: add sample plugin for game time [Carl]

-info.cpp: first attempt to fix the longstanding issue about inputs
 owned by devices being always tagged as P1 inputs in -lx.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-plugins/cheatfind: start lua cheat finder library [Carl]

-apple2: Additional work on the PC Transporter [Peter Ferrie, R. Belmont]

-Basic TCP server based on libuv [Inaki Baz Castillo,Miodrag Milanovic]

-intv: Converted controller inputs to be slot devices. [Fabio Priuli]

-intvecs: Converted hand controllers, keyboard and synth to be slot
 devices, by using a temporary hack to workaround the impossibility to
 plug the same device into 2 different slots as these keyboard require.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-Skeleton implementation for Universal windows main app classes. [Brad Hughes]

-String Translate for Chinese (Traditional / Simplified) [YuiFAN]

-diimage.cpp: Allow image devices to be configured with a fixed (not
 user selectable) piece of software and updated a few options and menu
 to acknowledge such possibility. [Fabio Priuli]

-macs.cpp: Converted to use generic cartslot with fixed software
 configuration. Cleaned up loading and banking systems in the driver as
 a result. [Fabio Priuli]

-Added extra bit as delay between bytes to make 1 stop bit work [Joakim Larsson]

-apple2: Further PC Transporter work.  V30 now boots. [Peter Ferrie, R. Belmont]

-mips3: Fixed DMULT and DMULTU in both interpreter and DRC modes. [marathonman]

-new Software List entry megadriv.xml: F1 - World Championship Edition
 (Euro, Prototype, set 2) [oliverthepig]

-ng_aes.cpp: converted AES controllers to work through slot devices.
 Also, separated more clearly the CD component by the base unit.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-am9517: add clone with the non-standard mask behavior of the PC
 Transporter ASIC [Carl, R. Belmont]

-apple2: updated PC Transporter to use alternate DMAC emulation & fixed
 V30 clock. [Peter Ferrie, R. Belmont]

-apple2: PC Transporter: halt V30 properly on startup, XT has 8-bit
 ISA, improved 6502 CGA framebuffer writes. [R. Belmont]

-screen: Fix alpha handling, cdkong looks good now [O. Galibert]

-bgfx: Add data-driven render target clearing [Ryan Holtz]

-neogeo: reworked inputs to work through the slot device interface. you
 can now configure the controllers available in the multicart driver
 (neogeo) with the -crtl1 and -ctrl2 options. when you run single game
 drivers (e.g. mslug, or kof94, etc.), instead, a unique controller is
 available and cannot be modified. [Fabio Priuli]

-Significant speed improvement:
 * added a new solver using compressed row format
 * fixed sorting
 As a result, netlist performance on kidniki nearly doubled. The
 performance increase is mainly due to the fact that sorting decreases
 the number of operations for gaussian elimination of the kidniki
 matrix from ~7800 to 707. In addition, compressed row format improves
 L1 usage. [Couriersud]

-Eliminate device_t::static_config, a type-unsafe legacy feature. [AJR]

 *Rewrite or remove every last instance of MCFG_DEVICE_CONFIG and its
  two aliases, including within comments and dead code.

 *Make the Z80/Z180 daisy chain an interface that interfaces with the
  existing interface. Z8000 has been hooked up to this as well (p8000_16
  already configures it), but currently does nothing with it.

-mips3: Fixed interpreter bug where BADCOP exceptions would execute the
 faulting opcode twice. [Ryan Holtz]

-Update strings.po [aviloria]

-Update German GUI translation [rootfather]

-Added ImGui based debugger.  [Barry Rodewald]

-apple2e: fix C800 internal ROM reading [R. Belmont]

-New PlayChoice-10 BIOS (Single Screen, Freeplay fix, Newer?) [Firehawke]

-apple2: fixed inverse text drawing. [R. Belmont]

-Added HQ2x, HQ3x and HQ4x shaders.  [MooglyGuy,Jules Blok,Cameron Zemek,Maxim Stepin]

-soft is hard and hard is soft. Two is one and one is two. No wonder
 "-video accel" has substandard performance if opengl is disabled.
 [Couriersud]

-These init calls all returned false. No need for a return value in
 this case. [Couriersud]

-Iterate over devices C++11 style [AJR]

 Replace the old device_iterator and its specialized versions with
 functionally equivalent classes that use standard operators to yield
 references to devices/interfaces rather than pointers. With
 range-based for loops, they no longer have to be stored in named
 variables, though they can also be reused concurrently since the
 iteration state is now maintained by a subclass.
 Add a few more typical getters to device_t::subdevice_list.

-bgfx: Added SuperEagle shader. [Ryan Holtz]

-Refactored distortion pass [ImJezze]
 * separated curvature parameter into distortion, cubic_distortion and
    distort_corner
 * distortion and cubic_distortion can be negative, to compensate each
    other
 * distort_corner is intependent from the image distortion

-neogeo.cpp: more accurate implementation of contollers through slot
 devices. If you want to launch janshin in the multislot driver
 (neogeo) you shall now prescribe
 * edge "" -ctrl1 mahjong and set accordingly the dipswitch. The
    janshin driver already comes pre-configured in the proper way,
    instead. [Fabio Priuli]

-Refactor OSD window.  [Brad Hughes]
 Unified renderer in osd_window as std::unique_ptr
 Made windows all std::shared_ptr<window_type> Made window lists
 std::list<std::shared_ptr<window_type>> Updated OSD SDL worker_param
 to not use malloc (not compatible with smart pointers) Made renderer
 pointer to window a weak reference. May not be available during
 destruction of the window.

-Alta Tensione: Added technical notes, game status, and patched the
 boot protection. [Roberto Fresca]

-Split UI and frontend part from core [Miodrag Milanovic]

-Implemented dynamic loading of precompiled solver code. [Couriersud]

-saturn.cpp: converted controllers to work through slot devices,
 cleaning up the related code. [Fabio Priuli]

-Sega Multitap adapter (6 controllers). Saturn Bomberman can now be
 played as intended. [Fabio Priuli]

-softlist.cpp: add support for "rom_ignore". [Fabio Priuli]

-itgambl2.cpp driver: Added technical notes and some clean-ups
 [Roberto Fresca]

-apple2: fixed Apple II J-Plus text drawing, and updated notes
 [R. Belmont]

-ioport.cpp: extended core input to support up to 10 players.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-dumped Dreamcast bios MPR-21933, confirmed match MPR-21931 [CoolMod]

-sf.c: does not have COIN3, and protection MCU on sfj is an i8751 [Yu]

-cgenie.cpp: expanded .cas support so that also files created by
 Genieous emulator can be loaded. [Fabio Priuli]

-Added "selection" parameter to chain input sampler [ImJezze]
 * if specified all textures (.png) within the same directoy of the
    given texture will be selectable via slider in the UI
 * also added slider for "shadow mask tile mode" to HLSL chain

-bgfx: Ported xBR shaders from libretro. [Ryan Holtz, Hyllian]

-Archive handling improvements [Vas Crabb]
 * Improve error handling in 7zip file I/O code
 * Fix 7zip files >=4GB on LP32/LLP64 targets
 * Support most ZIP64 features excluding directory compression
 * Fix phantom files/directories when browsing archives

-xbox\chihiro: usb is now partially usable [Samuele Zannoli]
 * control,bulk,interrupt transfers work
 * started hle simulation of usb devices on chihiro baseboard
 * there is a first implementation of xbox game controller
 * the chihiro bios can now enter system configuration menu
