    system specific to these bootlegs will need adding.

-Fix ppc64el issue #3157 [frediz]

-Pia6821 improvements (#5254) [Mike]
 * 6821pia: fix method names in comments
 * zwackery: Remove PIA port A z_mask setting.
 * This would only be relevant if the PIA was read while in output mode. These are inputs, and only read in input mode, so z_mask is
    not relevant.
 * thomson: move pia pullup resistors from z_mask to read handler.
 * 6821pia: remove unused set_port_a_z_mask calls.
 * dgn_beta: move pia pullup resistors from z_mask to read handler.
 * mpu3: Don't invert the VFD power on reset line.
 * It doesn't go through an inverter. I believe this was done to work around a bug in the PIA port A implementation.
 * pia6821: remove m_port_a_z_mask variable.
 * 6821pia: For port A reads, only use the DDR for reading pins unless.
 * Provide an override option when a device depends on slightly undefined behavior of an external device driving the pins and
    changing the value read.
 * One board seems to need this (coinmstr). I don't have the schematics, but it seems it uses this to check its meter operation.

-m72.cpp: Add GAL at IC3 for lohtb [parramon, ClawGrip]

-myb3k_fdc.cpp: Use FD1791 for FDC4711 As pointed out in #5256, the FDC4711 card uses an FD1791 chip as opposed to the MB8876A used
 on the FDC4710 and FDC4712. [protosphere]

-spectrum_cass.xml - start adding some sets [TZXVault]

-myb3k: Add support for FDC4712 Adds support for FDC4712 8-inch floppy disk controller card for MyBrain 3000 (and clones).
 [protosphere]
 * As part of this work I've moved common functionality between the FDC471x cards into a base class `isa8_myb3k_fdc471x_device_base`
    (as suggested in the file header). There's a few things I'm not completely happy with in regards to the implementation:
 * FDC4710 only supports connecting up to 2 disk drives. I've implemented this restriction with an
    `optional_device_array<floppy_connector, 4>` on the base class, with `isa8_myb3k_fdc4710_device::device_add_mconfig` only adding
    two floppy connectors, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach.
 * Motor control support is toggled via `has_motor_control`, which is set in each device subclass.
 * There are probably other things as well - any direction as to what the correct approaches are would be much appreciated.
 * MB8876 is used for the FDC in the base class, as this is the chip I've observed on real hardware.
 * Implementation of the card's status register was based on experimentation with real hardware (JB-3000 model). I believe the
    `FDC_STATUS_DOUBLE_SIDED` bit in the status register is specific to the FDC4712.
 * I've marked the FDC4712 as supporting 4 drives, as per the Peripherals Summary. My disk drive unit (2 drives) only has one cable
    running to the computer, however there is a cut-out in the case which would seem to allow you to daisy-chain a second disk drive
    unit.

-revert tzx_cas changes from 0.202, they break things @AmatCoder it appears the changes you made cause the various Speedlock loaders
 to fail (this is the vast majority of the full-price commercial library for the system after a certain point, so this is a major
 regression. [DavidHaywood]
 * as an example / test case, the following sets from the software list NO LONGER function in 0.202 due to the changes made.   (used
    with 'spectrum' machine)
 * batmana - fast loader - yellow/blue batmanb - fast loader with timer, black/blue batmanf - fast loader - yellow/blue
 * The following didn't change (mostly budget rereleases or alt tzx encodings that use different block types to represent the same
    things)
 * unknown loader/encoding (never worked due to flawed 0x19 - Generalized Data Block?) batmanc batmang
 * flashy border loaders (works before and after) batman batmand batmanh
 * misc fast loader (works before and after) batmane - fast loader - yellow/blue (works)

-Pia6821 improvements This is mostly about cleaning up how port A's register is read when in output mode. Previously, pins in output
 would always read their input value, but this is only true in a rare situation where a device was driving the pins. [hackbar]
 * This is a followup to PR 5175, which got rolled back. It's been tested with all the boards that were broken in
    https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/5175#issuecomment-500396359 .

-Better to document the GN680 I/O board I missed a small detail from that I/O board. There are actually two variations of this
 board. The one used in Operation: Thunder Hurricane uses a K056230 while the one in Teraburst uses a K056800. I guess this is how
 the assumption of this board used for networking and sound came into place. Thunder Hurricane's main pcb gets it's gun/analog
 values by networking with its I/O board while Teraburst has it's I/O board directly connected to its main pcb directly to the main
 cpu. The usage of an additional K056800 for Teraburst will remain unknown for now. [Hydreigon223]

    when it's set to input mode, but it doesn't look like MAME supports that right now.
 * This fixes 64KiB carts "Where Have All the Pixels Gone?" and "EigenVectrex," quite possibly others.

-Z80SIO: fixed a few regressions after PR #5115 Hi, [fulivi]
 * this commit fixes a few regressions caused by my last changes to Z80SIO driver. In detail:
 * + **altos5**, **isbc28612**, **isbc2861**, **c8002** now have the same exact image on screen as before at the end of 10 seconds
    of emulation, + **c5000** has one more word ("tape") displayed, probably because some initial self-test is now a bit faster, +
    **att4425** doesn't change after this fix, but I'm convinced that the current image is more correct (the one showing "keyboard
    test failed", as the generic rs232 keyboard that is connected has no loopback function).
 * This list of systems was provided by Tafoid as a comment to my last PR (#5115), it's probably not complete. I'll look into new
    regressions as they are reported. Thanks.

video hardware is bitmap based, but seems to have some control registers so palette etc. is set outside of the actual writes, might
  also disagree with how the ds5002fp core does memory addressing slightly as some bits seem to be fetched from the wrong places.
  ds5002fp dump we have is good enough to run the attract mode on PCB, only 2 suspicious bytes. [DavidHaywood]

Gals Panic (Modular System bootleg) [Juan Romero, Recreativas.org, ClawGrip, David Haywood]
these things are *ugly* from a hardware perspective (massive 6 board stack just for Gals Panic with many, many code hacks to work
  around hardware changes) so I felt it best to create a new driver with the background bits copy+pasted; the sprites + sound system
  specific to these bootlegs will need adding. [DavidHaywood]
