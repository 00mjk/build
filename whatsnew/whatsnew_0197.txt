-pc98_cd.xml: additions, testing & fixes [r09]
 * Updated the CD software list with everything from the latest update of the Neo Kobe Collection (too many new entries to list in a
    commit description).
 * Tested all software list entries, added supported status and emulation issues for each one. Some games need testing on real
    hardware to make sure the issues are emulation-related; I'll do this at a later date.
 * Added "usage" tag for games that require serials or manual protection.
 * Added disk 2 of the floppy version of Brandish Renewal, since it's used as a key disk for the CD version.
 * Fixed copy-paste error (interface="fmt_cdrom") for hybrid discs copied from the FM Towns list.
 * Replaced the Sweet Days CHD with a properly converted one.

-Add basic window move support to hp98544 framebuffer [Sven Schnelle]
 * HP Basic (and probably other OS') use the window mover to place letters on the screen by moving them from non-visible memory to
    the screen. Add basic support for that so that we have some output from HP basic. It also implements cursor control.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-legionna.cpp: fixed Godzilla OKI sound bankswitch [Angelo Salese]

-hp9k_3xx: workaround double exception during r-m-w operations [Sven Schnelle]
 * The m68k emulation code throws two buserror exception during r-m-w opcodes like ori #$0x40, (0x1234).b. This confuses the HP
    bootrom. Work around that by storing the last read buserror address and compare it with the write address. if they are the same,
    ignore the buserror.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <sven.schnelle@lancom.de>

-electron: Improved video handling. [Nigel Barnes]
 * Fixed wrap-around for non-standard screen start addresses
 * Added RAM contention during screen update
 * Improved interrupt times

-split up hp98603 basic rom card [Sven Schnelle]
 * The 98603A and 98603B cards have different base addresses and sizes for the rom region. Split up the cards so that we can boot HP
    BASIC 4 and HP BASIC 5.1.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-Set SO_REUSEADDR in posixsocket [Sven Schnelle]
 * Without it you have to wait until the socket is moved out of the TIME_WAIT state, which can take quite a while. This is pretty
    anoying when using mame with serial ports forwarded via TCP.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

 * remote488: removed sub-classing of bitbanger, back to plain bitb
 * remote488: re-introduced logging of parser FSM in a separated logging category

-XaviX - current checkpoint, tidying, reorganization etc. (+ general TV game work) (#3450) [David Haywood]
 * xavix - tidy ups, reorganization, current notes etc.
 * new machines marked as NOT WORKING Skannerz TV [Sean RIddle, Peter Wilhelmsen]
 * This will need the communication protocol with the barcode scanner unit reverse engeering (the scanner unit has it's own MCU that
    isn't dumped and for which we have no method of dumping) this also probably means it will need improvements to the general
    vii.cpp handling of interrupts and serial ports (which Cricket needs too)

-Gameboy camera rom functional (#3442) [Risugami]
 * cleaned up midvunit inputs and outputs. cleaned up seattle outputs.
 * better motion inputs and sorted main buttons for midvunit

 * This reverts commit ff815797c969621ad027dca12783f07f3d8f360a.

-Fixes to make basic boot on HP9000/300 (#3466) [Sven Schnelle]
 * hp9k_3xx: add dummy gpib handler
 * BASIC expects that there is an internal gpib card present. It crashes without, so let's add some dummy handlers for now.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>
 * hp9k_3xx: add fallback buserror handler
 * HP BASIC and the bootrom rely on buserror to figure out hardware configuration. Adding a global buserror handler makes BASIC boot
    on models >= 340. 310 doesn't show a picture with that handler, so let's leave them out for now.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>
 * hp9k_3xx: remove unneeded buserror handlers
 * Now that we have the fallback buserror handler in place, we don't need the other buserror handlers anymore.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>
 * hp9k_3xx: log accesses to gpib registers
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

 [RobertoFresca]

-Swapped popeyebl & popeyeb2, also repaired some of the proms as they appear to be bad dumps [smf]

-start hooking up Bionic Command MCU (similar to F1 Dream) however it still relies on some hacks to work at the moment
 [DavidHaywood]

-decap + dump f1dream I8751 MCU [Caps0ff] hookup dumped MCU to f1dream [David Haywood]
 * some connections might need verifying on the PCB, this is based on study of the code

-Fixes to make basic boot on HP9000/300 [sschnelle]

-Set SO_REUSEADDR in posixsocket Without it you have to wait until the socket is moved out of the TIME_WAIT state, which can take
 quite a while. This is pretty anoying when using mame with serial ports forwarded via TCP. [sschnelle]
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-split up hp98603 basic rom card The 98603A and 98603B cards have different base addresses and sizes for the rom region. Split up
 the cards so that we can boot HP BASIC 4 and HP BASIC 5.1. [sschnelle]
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-hp9k_3xx: workaround double exception during r-m-w operations The m68k emulation code throws two buserror exception during r-m-w
 opcodes like ori #$0x40, (0x1234).b. This confuses the HP bootrom. Work around that by storing the last read buserror address and
 compare it with the write address. if they are the same, ignore the buserror. [sschnelle]
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-Add basic window move support to hp98544 framebuffer HP Basic (and probably other OS') use the window mover to place letters on the
 screen by moving them from non-visible memory to the screen. Add basic support for that so that we have some output from HP basic.
 It also implements cursor control. [sschnelle]

-hp64k: added IEEE488 remotizer to bus Hi, [fulivi]
 * the commit in this PR adds the IEEE488 remotizer to HP64000 system. It also sub-classes the bitbanger device so that the switch
    on the command line for the remotizer is now "remt" and not a generic "bitb". Thanks.

-(PC-ISA): Add Action Replay card for DOS (1994) Allow write protect of a banked segment (dynamically allocated by ISA driver).
 [Bavarese]

-Relax constraints on address mirroring/global mask combinations. Mirror bits are now allowed to fall outside the driver-specified
 global mask, though memory map validation requires that they cover the entire masked-out portions of the address space if any do.
 [ajrhacker]
 * This change is intended to expedite debugging of software written for the TMPZ84C015 or similar Z80-based controllers which use
    8-bit I/O addressing for the on-chip peripherals but may use either 8-bit or 16-bit addressing externally.
 * Submitted as a PR to allow OG a chance to object. :-)

-Gameboy camera rom functional I decided not to attempt to emulate the camera itself yet. Instead the camera is reading from the
 first image in the save data. This lets the rest of the rom be used even though the camera remains unemulated. All of the registers
 to get it working are available. [Risugami]

 * Updated the CD software list with everything from the latest update of the Neo Kobe Collection (too many new entries to list in a
    commit description).
 * Tested all software list entries, added supported status and emulation issues for each one. Some games need testing on real
    hardware to make sure the issues are emulation-related; I'll do this at a later date.
 * Added "usage" tag for games that require serials or manual protection.
 * Added disk 2 of the floppy version of Brandish Renewal, since it's used as a key disk for the CD version.
 * Fixed copy-paste error (interface="fmt_cdrom") for hybrid discs copied from the FM Towns list.
 * Replaced the Sweet Days CHD with a properly converted one.
 * Some minor consistency / spelling fixes on descriptions.
