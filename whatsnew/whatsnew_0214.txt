 * Also, this comment clarify which SRAM chip constructs bgvideoram.

-tms34020: Fix BLMOVE aligment handling [Priit Laes]

-flex_dsk: fix the logging of the disk name extension [68bit]
 * It had been printing the disk name again.

-apple2: Initial support for ComputerEyes/2 slot card [R. Belmont, Golden Child]

-Fixed description Set xx -> set xx [MASHinfo]

-vsmile_cart.xml: New WORKING software list additions [ClawGrip]
 * --------------------------- Abenteuer im ABC Park (Germany, Rev. 3) [TeamEurope] The Batman - Rettung von Gotham City (Germany)
    [TeamEurope]

-swtpc09: add hard disk support for the DMAF3 controller [68bit]
 * This uses the WD1000 driver.
 * The DMAF2/3 6844 DMA support had to be improved to support multiple channels, and now supports a separate high addresses for each
    channel. It now also support addresses increasing or decreasing. These controllers use different DMA channels for the floppy and
    the hard disk, and also a tape archiver which is not yet implemented.
 * This gets UniFLEX running using a hard disk for storage, and does not appear to regress the floppy support or other variants
    using the DMAF2.

-k051649.cpp : Updates Fix mirroring in address map, Add save states, Fix spacing, Reduce unnecessary lines, Use shorter / correct
 type values [cam900]

-New working clone [braintro]

-f2mc16: More opcodes and more robust IRQ handling [R. Belmont]
 * mb9061x: Implemented timers 0 and 1, including external event counter mode [R. Belmont]

-MC6845: correct cursor. [68bit]
 * The MC6845 shows a full cursor if the cursor end raster address is greater than the maximum raster address, restore that case in
    general.
 * The issue on the BBC, that uses the HD6845S, might be the use of the maximum raster address here, it appears to be programmed
    differently on the HD6845S and also to depend on the interlaced mode. This patch fixes the BBC while preserving the cursor
    emulation for the MC6845.

-fix build [braintro]

-marineb.cpp: Filled in Difficulty for Hoccer & add dipswitch locations to most sets. [Brian Troha]

-asmjs: can not ignore errors on missing libraries [68bit]
 * The current Emscripten release is not happy with the use of "-s ERROR_ON_MISSING_LIBRARIES=0" as a link option, it gives an error
    stating that all libraries must now be present, so remove that use.
 * This leaves a missing 'util' library. This did not appear to be needed on the few builds I have tried, and this patch avoids
    adding this library for asmjs.

-asmjs: avoid explicitly linking SDL2_ttf. [68bit]
 * It appears that it is sufficient to include `-s USE_SDL_TTF=2`, and emcc links in the SDL2_tff library, and it does not like
    attempts to link this twice.

-chelnovjbl: Hook up MCU [Dirk Best]

-Spectrum betadisk stuff (#5564) [David Haywood]

-SH2 clock multiplier docs [MetalliC]

-Exposing running_machine::exit_pending() and running_machine::hard_reset_pending() to LUA [npwoods]

-Add dump and emulation of Alpha Micro AM-310 Communications Controller [AJR, Bitsavers]

-mc6845: address cursor display edge case in interlaced mode. [68bit]
 * It appears that the cursor is not displayed when the start raster address is equal to the maximum raster address in the
    'interlace and video' mode. At least this addresses a claimed regression in the 'apricot' machine. To be explore further on
    hardware.
 * The maximum raster address was also off by one in these calculations.

-f2mc16: fixed BBC branch offset, add savestates, cleanup variable usage in utility functions [R. Belmont]

-hh_sm510: Melody ROM fixes for gnw_mbaway melody [algestam]

-f2mc16: added more opcodes to diassembler, normalized bit syntax [R. Belmont]
 * This allows disassembling most of the Namco System 23 "Extra I/O" programs, which use an MB90611A.

-Emulate the Sega Billboard and hook it up to the STV driver [Dirk Best]
 * [biggestsonicfan, Dirk Best]
 * It's not shown by default. To view it, choose the layout view 'Billboard'.

-Fix the main cpu clock for the DE-0343 board [Yukari Tamura]
 * The 68000 core, DATA EAST chip 59, should run at 10.738636MHz. This is confirmed by DE-0343-4, Tumblepop. Pin 57 is for the
    clock.

-New working machine added (#5574) [algestam]
 * --------- Game & Watch: Vermin [algestam, hap, Mr. Do, Sean Riddle]

-gdbstub: more improvements (#5569) [Ramiro Polla]
 * gdbstub: small cleanup and clarification
 * Old GDBs expected the regnum values for some registers to be hardcoded. This is no longer the case with GDB clients that support
    target.xml.
 * We expect the GDB client to support target.xml (and won't support the 'g', 'G', 'p', and 'P' commands unless it is sent).
 * gdbstub: add mips (tested with indy_4610)
 * gdbstub: add m68k (tested with macii)
 * gdbstub: add support for executing MAME debugger commands from the GDB client
 * It's now possible to send MAME debugger commands, such as "cheatinit", "snap", etc...
 * Try not to use "bpset" and such commands, they may confuse the GDB client. Also don't use commands such as "step" and "go", they
    will definitely confuse the GDB client.
 * gdbstub: fatalerror() when socket can't be opened

 * The ROMs for this one are at https://68bit.org/mekd3.zip
 * Had a go at the RAM and ROM paging for this one, using a 'memory bank' with multiple entries. It appears to work, but it would
    have been nice to be able to view that complete bank in the debugger rather than just the current entry via the CPU region. Is
    it possible to have the debugger see a memory bank as a region? Might it be better to use a bank device?

-Don't force throttling while paused This tweak allows the user to decide if throttling should be forced while paused. Of course if
 we're just talking about the paused state, this makes no sense, but when we're frame-stepping, we might want throttling to go away.
 [vadosnaprimer]
 * I used an obscure option that's only checked in a single place and intended for debug use. Its nature seems to fit my purpose
    quite well, and it's also used along with `machine().paused()` in that one place that had it, exactly like I do here.
 * In my case, I control MAME remotely via luaengine and I have a periodic callback that advances a frame (among other things). When
    throttling is forced during pause, I can only get 50% speed with this method, even if I send `-video none -nothrottle`. Using
    frame advance on periodic callbacks seems to be required not to mess with the lua thread (not sure what exactly goes wrong
    there, it's just crashing in various places in lua source files). With this change, I can run at full unthrottled speed even
    during frame-advancing.

-MEKD4 and D5: new machines Motorola MC6809 evaluation board. This emulation implements the keypad and LED 7 segment display, and
 the RS-232 terminal interface, and the MEK68R2 MC6845 CRT and parallel keyboard interface. The RAM and ROM banking is not yet
 implemented but most of the D4BUG monitor commands are supported. [68bit]
 * Some questions if anyone cares to help me get up to speed with MAME:
 * If the machine emits sound for only a cassette interface then should it be flagged as `MACHINE_NO_SOUND`? Is that for a sound
    card rather than emulation of the machines noises?
 * This board includes an address bus comparator which can trigger an interrupt. It is used for tracing and debugging. This has been
    implement by general address read and write functions and a bank device to add another address map. Is there a cleaner way to do
    this in MAME?
 * The machine has multiple input devices, a keypad, a RS232 terminal, and a parallel keyboard which is part of a CRT interface. I
    could not see any way to change input focus in MAME, so this is managed by making the keypad clickable but with not keycodes,
    and separating the RS232 input and the CRT input via separate layout views and dropping the input if not in the appropriate
    view. Might there be a better way to do this in MAME?
 * The board supports a range of ROMS. If these were supported in the emulator then would that be implemented via the 'cart'
    support?

-HP9845: TACO driver re-written Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR is for the complete re-write of HP TACO driver. The re-write was prompted by the publication of a HP internal doc about
    TACO in late 2018. The previous driver was written with just reverse-engineered info available. I also re-factored the DC100
    tape cartridge driver into a separated device so that all the tape motion and data R/W is handled there. I adapted the 1MA6
    driver and the HP9825 tape sub-system to this new device. I also had to change the HTI tape format (and hp9845_tape/hp85_tape
    modules in imgtool) because I found out that data words are actually 16-bit long in HP9845 and HP85 cases, whereas they are
    17-bit long in HP9825. Previously, I was convinced that all systems stored 17-bit words on tape. The new format keeps the "hti"
    file extension but the magic at the start of file has changed to "HTI0" (previous one was "TACO"). The old "TACO" format is
    still accepted and it's transparently converted to the new format when loaded.
 * In this PR I also fixed a small bug in HP Hybrid CPU emulation that caused hp9825t to hang when computing logarithms (for
    example).
 * Thanks,
 * -F.Ulivi

new NOT WORKING ClickStart [Sean Riddle, Clawgrip, TeamEurope] + a Software List for it [Tom]
seems to be something missing, jumps to outside of code area, maybe secondary small internal ROM of CPU.  I did think the dumps were
  half size for various reasons, but there is a checksum in the footer of each one that matches the data (even if another checksum
  in the header for some of them we can't match)  Possible BIOS is wrong tho as that checksum in the footer doesn't match by quite a
  significant amount. [Tom]
most games show something just by putting a 'RET' opcode in the upper areas it attempts to jump to. [Tom]

ds5k133: Preliminary LANCE DMA hookup [R. Belmont]
If you can parse this comment from the Linux driver, please help :) [Tom]
The IOASIC LANCE devices use a shared memory region.  This region [Tom]
as seen from the CPU is (max) 128 kB long and has to be on an 128 kB [Tom]
boundary.  The LANCE sees this as a 64 kB long continuous memory [Tom]
region. [Tom]
[Tom]
The LANCE's DMA address is used as an index in this buffer and DMA [Tom]
takes place in bursts of eight 16-bit words which are packed into [Tom]
four 32-bit words by the IOASIC.  This leads to a strange padding: [Tom]
16 bytes of valid data followed by a 16 byte gap :-(. [Tom]
I get the first part, which is that since the DMA engine works in words and [Tom]
LANCE works in half-words that each half-word for LANCE is packed into one [Tom]
word from the CPU's point of view.  The second part not so much. [Tom]
