 32.768kHz  crystal  these  3  bits  are  used to  turn  the  oscillator  on  or  off  and  to  reset  the  countdown  chain. There
 are not used anymore to select the main clock divider value. [Jean-François DEL NERO]

-chdman: Patch to allow chdman to access physical drives on Windows 10 Provided as a potential fix for physical drive access using
 chdman in Windows 10.  There may be cleaner/better methods. This patch allows chdman to access a physical drive in Windows 10 from

-z80scc: general cleanup part III More minor cleanups [JoakimLarsson]

-Fixes to hcd62121 CPU emulation. Fixes to hcd62121 CPU emulation based on experiments with the actual hardware (using a CFX-9850G).
 [rsfb]
 * With these fixes, the CFX-9850G is emulated just accurately enough for most of the RUN mode to work well.
 * Further reverse-engineering is ongoing.

-z80scc: general cleanup and backport of z80sio improvements In preparation for synchronous modes and general shape up of the code,

-pgm2 - add kov2nl internal rom [Morten Shearman Kirkegaard, Peter Wilhelmsen]

-vt240: palette, screen size fix Bit order in Video Output Map verified via ReGIS palette escape sequences.   Raster width is
 specified as 800 on page 6-40 of technical manual. [shattered]

-Templated Hyperstone operations PoC This demonstrates templating the immediate and register-register logical op handlers.  Since
 `DST_GLOBAL`, `SRC_LOCAL` and `IMM_LONG` are template parameters rather than function parameters, the compiler emits four versions
 of each handler for each of its four permutations.  The template argument values must be compile-time constants, so conditional
 code that depends on them gets flattened and doesn't cause runtime branches or conditional moves. [cuavas]
 * This is done as a PR so @MooglyGuy can take a look and/or do a performance test.  I gave it a quick test with some of the games
    and this didn't break them or cause performance penalties (using a 2010 i7 notebook).  Sorry I didn't get the `ldxx1` op handler
    done, I had limited time before dinner.  If it looks promising I can convert more handlers.

-fmtowns: Fix scrolling in 16-color mode This fixes some scrolling / screen positioning issues with some games in 16-color mode:
 [rzero9]
 * Air Management Brandish Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu III SP Schwarzschild IV Vain Dream Vain Dream II
 * And possibly others I haven't tested yet.
 * Scrolling still isn't quite perfect everywhere but it should be much better than before.

-dumped internal IGS036 rom for Oriental Legend 2 [Morten Shearman Kirkegaard and Peter Wilhelmsen] dumped internal IGS036 rom for
 Oriental Legend 2 [Morten Shearman Kirkegaard and Peter Wilhelmsen] started adding some devices to the driver to support it [David
 Haywood] derived IGS036 type in ARM7/9 core, because it seems like mmu could be different, and there are probably other internal
 devices [David Haywood] fixed(?) BLX (LO) thumb opcode in ARM7/9 core, was storing a return address that skipped the following
 opcode [David Haywood]
 * I think there might still be ARM9 issues.

-Added missing Kaypro models, distributed ROM files accordingly [rfka01]
 * renamed kaypro4 to kayproiv (cf. boot message) and kaypro4a to kaypro484
 * make Kaypro use standard disk formats, if this is approved, kaypro_dsk.cpp and .h can be removed
 * added kaypro1084, kaypro1, kaypro4x, kaypro284 and kaypronew2 as well as II plus 88
 * made kaypro484 the parent for the later non-10/non-Robie machines
 * made the 4 plus 88 a '84 generation machine in keeping with adverts of the time and photographic evidence - the plus 88 board is
    a CoPower 88 from SWP and could also be bought indepentently
 * distributed ROMs evenly, and marked dumps bad where appropriate
 * put handyman ROM into kaypro2x, this ROM can be added to all other Kaypro drivers once it's got its own 16K RAM added and
    connected
 * Kaypro is SS/DD or DS/DD, offer DS/QD as option, it was supported by third party ROMs

-Update strings.po Update Spanish translation [aviloria]

-HP85: Internal printer added Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR adds the emulation of HP85 internal printer. It also tries to address some of the remarks in PR #2749 by V.Crabb. Thank

 time. [martinlindhe]
 * (the 3rdparty folder has been ignored)

-Updates to trs80dt1 driver trs80dt1.cpp: Keyboard sense is now correct Frame rate now consistent with jumpering to 60hz Display is
 now stable, but shows every other line on the top and bottom half of the screen. Added temporary hack to display the last 3 columns
 (timing issue to be resolved) [palazzol]
 * i8275.cpp: Added check to avoid buffer overflow

-Fix DS128X/DS1288X main frequency divider. The output frequency must be fixed to 1HZ with these devices. [jfdelnero]
 * In  the  MC146818, DV2-DV0  were  used  to  select  the input frequency to provide a proper time base. Since the DS12885/87 and
    DS1685/87 use only the 32.768kHz  crystal  these  3  bits  are  used to  turn  the  oscillator  on  or  off  and  to  reset  the
    countdown  chain. There are not used anymore to select the main clock divider value.

-fmtowns: fix kanji offset calculation The kanji characters currently displayed using the fixed ROM font (mainly the boot messages)
 are wrong. This fixes the offset calculation so the appropriate characters are displayed, e.g.: [rzero9]
 * ディスクエラーが発生しました (a disk error has occurred) instead of ディスクエラーが遣宛しました (gibberish) システム読み込み中です (the system is loading) instead of
    システム局み扶み恰です (gibberish)
 * And so on.

-Bus error stack frame : 68010 / 68020 / 68030 stack frames formats support added. [jfdelnero]

 * In NCV1 Xevious Arrangement, scrolling-by-row feature is used to draw and move UFOs in 'AREA 8'. I think this is the only part

 [JoakimLarsson]

-interpro: keyboard and graphics Many changes in this PR, including the following: [pmackinlay]
 * added support for InterPro 20x0, 24x0 and 27x0 systems
 * added support for SR bus/slot devices
 * added support for Ethernet, graphics, keyboard and mouse
 * added support for serial DMA
 * improved timer, interrupt and DMA handling
 * improved comments/documentation
 * Note: ioga is still a major work in progress, and most of the other *ga's don't do anything useful yet, however this build can do
    some new and useful things, and it's closer to OS boot than before, as well as cleaned up in some of the better known areas.

-HP85: support for I/O slots & HP-IB interface module Hi. This PR introduces the handling of I/O slots in HP85 emulation. It also
 introduces the emulation of HP82937 module that interfaces HP85 with HPIB peripherals (with HP9895 disk drive, for example). By
 using the Mass storage ROM it's now possible to read & write floppy disks in HP9895 drive. I'm going to e-mail the dump of 82937
 firmware to the usual "code" address. Thanks. [fulivi]
 * -F.Ulivi

-T4490 added, Terco CNC Mill 4490 skeleton driver [JoakimLarsson]

-interpro: expansion bus/slots and keyboard This PR is a request for an initial once-over for general hygiene. If/when it's
 acceptable, it'll be followed by a commit to the InterPro base machine with a number of changes and improvements that take
 advantage of this. [pmackinlay]
 * Anyway, this contains:
 * basic support for the system bus variously referred to as SR, SR bus, SRX and CBUS
 * an initial GT graphics card implementation, only supports the video ram and ramdac for now, but sufficient to boot the diagnostic
    monitor in graphics mode
 * a high-level emulation of the InterPro keyboard with US English layout

-Update namcos12.cpp Correct Ehrgeiz, Golgo 13 Kiseki no Dandou Year [sjy96525]
