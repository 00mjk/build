-apple2: preliminary support for "SSB Apple" speech board [R. Belmont, Apple II Documentation Project]

-Fix DS128X/DS1288X main frequency divider. The output frequency must be fixed to 1HZ with these devices. In  the  MC146818, DV2-DV0
 were  used  to  select  the input frequency to provide a proper time base. Since the DS12885/87 and DS1685/87 use only the
 32.768kHz  crystal  these  3  bits  are  used to  turn  the  oscillator  on  or  off  and  to  reset  the  countdown  chain. There
 are not used anymore to select the main clock divider value. [Jean-François DEL NERO]

 * V9938-on-V9938 transparent overlay is fixed for meritm.cpp (was broken a few releases ago).

-apple2cp: MIG RAM is 2K, not 0.5K. [mgcaret, R. Belmont]

 (timing issue to be resolved) [palazzol]
 * i8275.cpp: Added check to avoid buffer overflow

-Fix DS128X/DS1288X main frequency divider. The output frequency must be fixed to 1HZ with these devices. [jfdelnero]
 * In  the  MC146818, DV2-DV0  were  used  to  select  the input frequency to provide a proper time base. Since the DS12885/87 and
    DS1685/87 use only the 32.768kHz  crystal  these  3  bits  are  used to  turn  the  oscillator  on  or  off  and  to  reset  the
    countdown  chain. There are not used anymore to select the main clock divider value.

-Bus error stack frame : 68010 / 68020 / 68030 stack frames formats support added. [jfdelnero]

    some new and useful things, and it's closer to OS boot than before, as well as cleaned up in some of the better known areas.

-HP85: support for I/O slots & HP-IB interface module Hi. This PR introduces the handling of I/O slots in HP85 emulation. It also
 introduces the emulation of HP82937 module that interfaces HP85 with HPIB peripherals (with HP9895 disk drive, for example). By
 using the Mass storage ROM it's now possible to read & write floppy disks in HP9895 drive. I'm going to e-mail the dump of 82937
 firmware to the usual "code" address. Thanks. [fulivi]
 * -F.Ulivi

-interpro: expansion bus/slots and keyboard This PR is a request for an initial once-over for general hygiene. If/when it's
 acceptable, it'll be followed by a commit to the InterPro base machine with a number of changes and improvements that take
 advantage of this. [pmackinlay]
 * Anyway, this contains:
 * basic support for the system bus variously referred to as SR, SR bus, SRX and CBUS
 * an initial GT graphics card implementation, only supports the video ram and ramdac for now, but sufficient to boot the diagnostic
    monitor in graphics mode
 * a high-level emulation of the InterPro keyboard with US English layout
