 status register read, command register write. Setting conditions: command-specific (completion etc), command 0xDX is in command
 register and one of I0-3 conditions met. Various WD FDC doc's statements 'command D0 is the only command which may clear interrupt
 after D8' is not correct, any other than Dx command write to command register will do this aw well. [MetalliC]

 * gamate.c: don't use magical number for memory size

-fmtowns: bring machine configurations a bit closer to real hardware (#5719) [r09]
 * fmtowns: bring machine configurations a bit closer to real hardware
   - Separated the SCSI controller from the base machine configuration and turned it into an optional device, since the
      first-generation models and the Marty don't have one.
 * Changed the CPU of the FM Towns II SJ to a 66 MHz 486DX2 instead of a Pentium.
 * Added comments describing the RAM expansion possibilities in each model, and modified the user-selectable options accordingly.
 * Added a separate machine configuration for the FM Towns II MX, since it has a different CPU and more RAM options than the HR.
 * Corrected memory maps for the 386SX-based models so the VRAM is accessible at 0xb00000 in packed format. Fixes several instances
    of graphics being garbled on the UX and Marty.
 * Configured the Marty with just one floppy drive and 2 MB of RAM.
 * Added a couple of sanity checks to prevent MAME from crashing when selecting 1 MB of RAM or a single floppy drive. This makes it
    possible to emulate something reasonably close to the functionality of an original FM Towns Model 1, though the real Model 1/2
    ROMs still need to be dumped.

    applied to objective c++ files. As such, hardcoding -x offers no benefit while preventing overrides (such as one needed by
    3rdparty/bgfx/src/renderer_vk.cpp on macOS) from working.
 * Re-introduce -x c++ in places where C code is compiled as C++ to prevent clang from throwing a warning
 * Build bgfx as Objective-C++ on macOS It is needed due to included headers
 * Enable Direct3D12 and Vulkan bgfx rendering backends
 * Enable building of spirv shaders

-Check that m_display is not null to prevent crash (#5725) [George McMullen]
 * Check that m_display is not null to prevent crash
 * https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=7372
 * Probe method to check if X11 is actually being used
 * As per: https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/5725#issuecomment-540004475 this will help MAME verify X11 has no inputs when X11 is
    not actually being used (e.g. on RetroPie where SDL display is RPI).
 * Fix issue where a lightgun with no name would return nullptr
 * As suggested by https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/5725#issuecomment-539914514 , a bug in create_lightgun_device() returned
    nullptr if the lightgun had no name. Now it will create the device with a name using the lightgun's device index
 * Change older m_display change to assert
 * This module can now be probed and  disabled correctly if X11 is not being used. Removed the if statements that would be called
    every cycle (and fail silently) in favor of asserts, as MAME does not currently handle dynamic hardware configuration changes.
 * Fixing semicolons in asserts that were ifs

-fmtowns: add the Model 2 ROMs (#5732) [r09]
 * fmtowns: add the Model 2 ROMs
   - Dumped and added the ROMs from an first-generation FM Towns Model 2, and made it the parent set. For now we'll assume that the
      Model 1 ROMs are the same, since the only differences between them are the amount of floppy drives and RAM.
 * Removed the old "fmtowns" set, since its ROMs completely match the FM Towns II MX ones after splitting them.
 * Renamed and added a few comments to the "fmtownsa" set so the description is a bit more accurate. It seems to be from a
    third-generation model, probaby a CX.
 * Added a comment with a list of all the known FM Towns models.

-at.cpp: small BIOS name correction, RAM and cache information, motherboards and BIOS versions [rfka01]

-Netlist: code maintenance and bug fixes. [Couriersud]
 * optimized the core queue dispatching logic. Minor performance increase.
 * fixed a number of bugs in parray. Now parray<double, 0> will be purely dynamic allocation with the number of elements passed in

 * snes: The SNES only has 64kbytes of VRAM, not 128kbytes. Fixes graphics in Yoshi's Island, probably others. [Ryan Holtz, byuu]

-ins8250: fix cleared pending THRE interrupt [68bit]
 * The code notes that reading the iir register "will clear the int if this is the source of the int" and the code cleared a pending
    THRE interrupt if it was *pending*. This causes a lost THRE interrupt for the SWTPC 8121 terminal firmware and this locks up the
    TX side of the terminal. This occurred regularly when the ISR read this register upon a higher priority RX pending interrupt.
    The documented operation has been reinterpreted as only clearly the THRE interrupt if THRE is the highest priority interrupt and
    so is the pending interrupt *causing* the interrupt. This fixes that lost THRE interrupt for the SWTPC 8121 terminal.

-SWTPC MP-S2: connect up the RS232 control lines [68bit]
 * At least some of these are required for operation with terminals. For example the SWTPC 8212 terminal uses DTR to CTS for
    hardware flow control, and that is needed even at 9600 baud.

-New working software list additions [ArcadeShadow]

-citybomb, hcrash: Add ADC0804 device (fixes "WRONG CONTROL IO" in citybomb service mode) [AJR]

-IE15 terminal: rework the RS232 interfaces [68bit]
 * The RS232 port has been moved out of the ie15 device. It is only needed in stand alone operation, and not when connected to the
    rs232 bus, it was odd leaving it in there, odd to still have an rs232 port slot option when running stand alone.
 * The IE15 UART implementation has been removed from the rs232 bus code and back into the ie15 device code. This leaves the rs232
    bus code dealing with only serial data, and not the parallel data, and that should make it easier in future to have a common
    interface to RS232 terminals.

 * Enable tools build for travis to make it more useful
 * Switch travis to Xcode 11 in order to fix nltool linking failure
 * Prefer 64-bit compiler with VS 2019 too
 * Setting PreferredToolArchitecture to x64 is not needed, genie puts it into the project files for vs2015 or later
 * OPTIMIZE=1 build is faster that OPTIMIZE=0 for some reason. So fast in fact, that TOOLS=1 can be enabled without hitting the 60
    minute timeout
 * Switch MINGW build to VS 2017 image until appveyor figure out why builds on VS 2019 are almost twice as slow

-RS232: move some initialization to a device_reset() function (#5748) [68bit]

    wish to read ioports and that is not safe at this stage, so move these to a new device_reset() function.

-mame/video/tmap038.cpp : Device-fied 038 Tilemap generator (#5704) [cam900]

-luaengine: reduce memory usage during compilation [feos]
 * Previous semantics were encouraged by sol2, and ThePhD admitted it was a bad idea for usertypes with lots of members. sol3 allows
    to assign members outside a constructor for regular usertypes, but mame can't move to sol3 because it requires C++17. Turns out
    sol2 also has a way to add members separately, and that is what I used. This helps immensely.
 * This approach required a fix to warning C5046 copied from here
    https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2/commit/57990845726e17fba11a39cfcb1fc0127a7ea638
 * Tested current mame plugins, everything seems to work.
 * PS: Due to come black magic, if I use simple_usertype::set() with "manager" as well, "machine" member dies (others are fine!), so
    I had to leave it intact.

-IE15 terminal: rework the RS232 interfaces The RS232 port has been moved out of the ie15 device. It is only needed in stand alone
 operation, and not when connected to the rs232 bus, it was odd leaving it in there, odd to still have an rs232 port slot option
 when running stand alone. [68bit]
 * The IE15 UART implementation has been removed from the rs232 bus code and back into the ie15 device code. This leaves the rs232
    bus code dealing with only serial data, and not the parallel data, and that should make it easier in future to have a common
    interface to RS232 terminals.
 * This is to illustrate some points raised in PR https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/5729 the SWTPC 8212 terminal proposal. This
    IE15 terminal proposal uses the same interface function names, and interfaces to the ie15 device using only serial data as is
    done for the swtpc8212 which has an implemented UART. If people agree that this is a move in the right direction then you might
    please consider merge this. Not claiming that his pushes the IE15 implementation along, it is just a proposed source code
    cleanup.

-RS232: move some initialization to a device_reset() function Calling the line handlers, such as m_cts_handler() from the
 device_start() function is problematic as some of these handlers may wish to read ioports and that is not safe at this stage, so
 move these to a new device_reset() function. [68bit]
 * When adding a write line function for a serial line, to route the line based on config options, it fails to initialize claiming
    that reading the ioport is not safe. It appears to have been due to the calls from the res232 device_start() function, and
    moving them to a device_reset() function worked around that.

-SWTPC MP-S2: connect up the RS232 control lines At least some of these are required for operation with terminals. For example the

 be an FM Towns II MX. [rzero9]
 * For now this is a software dump, made from DOS with the "rombeger" tool included with the Unz emulator. I hope to get physical
    dumps of at least the two socketed chips in the near future, when I have the necessary tools, but judging from the MX example,
    the software dumps should match the real ones.

    changed the descriptions a bit to be more accurate, and also added a list with every known model to the source comments.

 that reflect the actual onboard/SIMM combinations for each model. It also includes a couple of bugfixes and sanity checks to
 prevent emulator crashes I've found along the way. [rzero9]

 draw routine into tmap038.cpp cave.cpp : Add notes, Fix spacing, Reduce duplicates mcatadv.cpp : Simplify handlers, Reduce
 unnecessary line, Fix tilemap flicker with debug function enabled, Use shorter/correct type values [cam900]

-Continuous integration improvements As the only remaining build failures only affect debug build of tools, tweak the configuration
 so that the build can actually complete: [belegdol]
 * disable tools build
 * switch to release build while disabling optimization
 * no longer allow msvc build to fail

-Update Apple 2 softlists to October 2nd, 2019 [Firehawke]

-apple3: Corrected number row key layout to fix pasting. The number row used to use the Apple 2 layout and so text didn't paste into
 MAME correctly. Shifted number keys now paste correctly. [pahandav]

-Fix AVI framerate MAME was setting up AVI before devices have properly launched, so default 60fps was used, which resulted in
 skipped frames in the video if machine's framerate is above 60 (btoads), and presumably duplicate frames for machines below 60fps
 (haven't tested). [vadosnaprimer]
 * Now every frame that is generated is also present in the video.
 * Test script (dump avi with framecount display):
 * ```lua local function getscreen() for k,v in pairs(manager:machine().screens) do return v end end
 * local screen = getscreen()
 * local function framecount() str = "frame: " .. screen:frame_number() print(str) screen:draw_text(0, 0, str, 0xffffffff,
    0xff000000) end
 * emu.register_frame_done(framecount) ```

-tms34020: Implement SETCDP opcode This pull request implements `SETCDP` opcode for tms34020. [plaes]
 * Standalone testcase here: https://gist.github.com/plaes/dec4b76ffc4b720726f21031d8d399ac
 * Changes in v3:
 * Dropped log2 usage in favor of `32 - count_leading_zeros()`
 * Dropped useless includes
 * Fixed formatting for braces
 * Use logical or instead of sum
 * Changes in v2:
 * Use functions from eminline.h (population_count_32 instead of __builtin_popcount and count_leading_zeros instead of
    __builtin_ffs)
 * Use `log2` from `<cmath>`
 * Fix pointless `log2` calls in the double power of two case.

-vs2019 fixes, initial clang-cl support This should resolve the worst of the issues listed in #5695. The alternative builds are
 either not tested or do not work, but with the changes the project files are at least being created in the correct folders. The PR
 also adds initial hooks needed to build using Visual Studio's own LLVM/Clang:
 https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clang-llvm-support-for-msbuild-projects/ Building using clang still needs some work  - as of
 now it runs of memory building frontend.vcxproj but this should be hopefully relatively easy to fix for someone who knows what they
 are doing. [belegdol]

-nmk16spr.cpp : Device-fied NMK 16 bit sprite hardware Original source by nmk16.cpp, with Fix flipped case, Allow pdrawgfx drawing
 nmk16.cpp, powerins.cpp : Convert sprite draw routine into nmk16spr.cpp nmk16.cpp : Fix manybloc flipped screen, Remove unused
 powerins.cpp : Verify clock related to on-board XTALs, Add screen raw params [cam900]

-Allow updating version.cpp when IGNORE_GIT=1 is passed Without this tweak it would only create the file if it doesn't exist, and
 wouldn't update an existing one. [vadosnaprimer]

-ay8910.cpp : Device-fied sunsoft 5B sound hardware [cam900]
 * It has Yamaha SSG volume/envelope parameters, single sound output and internal divider.
 * Manufactured by Yamaha

-fmtowns_cd.xml: additions, better dumps, updated missing list [rzero9]
 * Replaced entries with dumps from the redump.org database, with proper track indexes and offset correction:
 * The 4th Unit 6 - Merry-Go-Round Air Warrior V1.1 Dragon Shock Final Blow Ms. Detective File #1 - Iwami Ginzan Satsujin Jiken
    Rance III - Leazas Kanraku Sherlock Holmes - Consulting Detective Turbo Out Run The Visitor
 * Added new working dumps from the redump.org database:
 * Shanghai
 * Added new NOT working dumps from the redump.org database (most of these are missing floppy disks):
 * Air Warrior V1.2 Fujitsu Habitat V2.1L10 Hyper Media NHK Zoku Kiso Eigo: Dai-3-kan Nobunaga no Yabou: Sengoku Gun'yuuden Taito
    Chase H.Q. (Demo)
 * Added a parent-clone relationship between the Windows 3.1 revisions
 * Updated the missing list with some recently confirmed software

-Rebase and completion of split out of epc driver and addition of graphics card This replaces PR #5312 The EPC can now boot from
 floppy and a new LLE serial keyboard is functional. Credits for the dump of the keyboard 6801 MCU goes to the people at Dalby
 Datormuseum whom I collaborated with in a dumper project: [JoakimLarsson]
 * https://sites.google.com/site/dalbydatormuseum/home https://github.com/MattisLind/6801reader

-[snes] Run HTOTAL double only if needed Also run HDMA when vpos=0 [AmatCoder]
 * Fix Vortex & Judge Dreed graphics

-Lua callback after sound update has generated new samples [vadosnaprimer]
-New samples are generated independently from the video system, vblank, frames, etc. Sound update uses its own timer and fires 50
 times per second. So if we want to grab the sound buffer, we need to do it 50 times per second as well.
 * This PR adds a callback that fires whenever audio has been updated and new samples have been generated. I tested it with this
    script and got the same output as from `-wavwrite`:
 * ```lua local function log(s, name) logfile = io.open(name, "ab") -- binary mode is required, otherwise junk gets appended along
    the way logfile:write(s) logfile:close() end
 * emu.register_sound_update(function() local samples = manager:machine():sound():samples() log(samples, "check.wav") end) ```

-Synced with GENie upstream revision e78d6c1 Please do not merge this yet, I still need to test the changes. Once merged this will
 resolve issue #5597. [belegdol]
