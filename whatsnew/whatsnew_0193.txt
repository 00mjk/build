-Update for Brazilian Portuguese [Wellington Uemura]
 * All translation updated to follow GNOME Translation Rules for Brazilian Portuguese, this are the same rules for other Linux
    Distributions, Manuals, etc. Now we can avoid translation conflicts. http://br.gnome.org/GNOMEBR/ErrosFrequentes
    http://br.gnome.org/GNOMEBR/GuiaDoTradutor
 * Brazilian Portuguese REQUIRE context, it doesn't matter what a word say, we need to see what the program is doing instead of what
    the word/phrase is saying to construct the phrase correctly.
 * That ROM AUDITION functions means nothing in Brazilian Portuguese, so the translation was adapted to "Condição", this reflects
    better if the ROM is GOOD/BAD, etc.
 * OK has different meanings in Brazilian Portuguese, if you ask someone if the food was good and you reply "OK", it means that the
    food  are between good and bad or more or less. Since "Ok" doesn't reflect if the ROM is good or not, the translation was
    changed to "BOA" witch means "GOOD" following Brazilian Portuguese concordance rules "Estado dA ROM" this "A" tell us to use
    "boA" (female) instead of "BOM"(male).
 * Some parts of the translation was also adapted to fit the screen or the space the phrase is at.
 * To our language, the correct translation to plugin is plug-in.
 * A few more mistakes were fixed like Enter (to type in) = Digite not "Entre" (to get inside of) or Search = Pesquisa not "Busca",
    etc.

-et3400: Add reset key [AJR]

-weststory: verified sprite data by converting original mask rom into bootleg format and figuring out what was scrambled from there,
 it's a very simple but quite stupid bitswap on 2 of the roms.  made a note that one byte actually differs in the bootleg even after
 this, since it's been verified on 2 bootlegs it could be the original mask rom has a bad byte in it instead, should really be
 checked. [David Haywood]

-et3400: Add "Segment Test" input [AJR]

-riscpc: fix ROM load for rpc600. [R Belmont]

-Update French translation [SSTSylvain]

-jvc_dsk: Fix MT #06779 [Dirk Best]

-emumem: API change [O. Galibert]
 * direct_read_data is now a template which takes the address bus shift as a parameter.
 * address_space::direct<shift>() is now a template method that takes the shift as a parameter and returns a pointer instead of a
    reference
 * the address to give to {read|write}_* on address_space or direct_read_data is now the address one wants to access
 * Longer explanation:
 * Up until now, the {read|write}_* methods required the caller to give the byte offset instead of the actual address.  That's the
    same on byte-addressing CPUs, e.g. the ones everyone knows, but it's different on the word/long/quad addressing ones (tms,
    sharc, etc...) or the bit-addressing one (tms340x0).  Changing that required templatizing the direct access interface on the bus
    addressing granularity, historically called address bus shift.  Also, since everybody was taking the address of the reference
    returned by direct(), and structurally didn't have much choice in the matter, it got changed to return a pointer directly.
 * Longest historical explanation:
 * In a cpu core, the hottest memory access, by far, is the opcode fetching.  It's also an access with very good locality (doesn't
    move much, tends to stay in the same rom/ram zone even when jumping around, tends not to hit handlers), which makes efficient
    caching worthwhile (as in, 30-50% faster core iirc on something like the 6502, but that was 20 years ago and a number of things
    changed since then).  In fact, opcode fetching was, in the distant past, just an array lookup indexed by pc on an offset
    pointer, which was updated on branches.  It didn't stay that way because more elaborate access is often needed (handlers,
    banking with instructions crossing a bank...) but it still ends up with a frontend of "if the address is still in the current
    range read from pointer+address otherwise do the slowpath", e.g. two usually correctly predicted branches plus the read most of
    the time.
 * Then the >8 bits cpus arrived.  That was ok, it just required to do the add to a u8 *, then convert to a u16/u32 * and do the
    read.  At the asm level, it was all identical except for the final read, and read_byte/word/long being separate there was no
    test (and associated overhead) added in the path.
 * Then the word-addressing CPUs arrived with, iirc, the tms cpus used in atari games.  They require, to read from the pointer, to
    shift the address, either explicitely, or implicitely through indexing a u16 *. There were three possibilities:
 * 1- create a new read_* method for each size and granularity.  That amounts to a lot of copy/paste in the end, and functions with
    identical prototypes so the compiler can't detect you're using the wrong one.
 * 2- put a variable shift in the read path.  That was too expensive especially since the most critical cpus are byte-addressing
    (68000 at the time was the key).  Having bit-adressing cpus which means the shift can either be right or left depending on the
    variable makes things even worse.
 * 3- require the caller to do the shift himself when needed.
 * The last solution was chosen, and starting that day the address was a byte offset and not the real address.  Which is, actually,
    quite surprising when writing a new cpu core or, worse, when using the read/write methods from the driver code.
 * But since then, C++ happened.  And, in particular, templates with non-type parameters.  Suddendly, solution 1 can be done without
    the copy/paste and with different types allowing to detect (at runtime, but systematically and at startup) if you got it wrong,
    while still generating optimal code.  So it was time to switch to that solution and makes the address parameter sane again.
    Especially since it makes mucking in the rest of the memory subsystem code a lot more understandable.

 * Minor fixes and typos. Added @felipesanches requests Shorted some strings as @felipesanches requests, not all "IU" was changed
    because it breaks the interface or is too big. We will have to deal with the "parent" and "clone" thing later, maybe the use of
    RAMIFICAÇÃO (RAMIFICATION OF) that will better reflect with our Language.

-Better layout views for et3400 including display labels and clickable keypad (github #2862) [Vas Crabb]

-fixing/improving metadata on CoCo FDCs: CP-450 and CD-6809 [Felipe Corrêa da Silva Sanches]
 * Thanks to Daniel Campos & Datassette.org for the CP-450 disk rom. MAME was calling it CP400_FDC, but the correct name of the disk
    controller unit is "Prológica CP-450". The ROM was correct (verified checksum), but I renamed it to fix the previous naming
    mistake. Unfortunately this FDC unit is rare, so I still don't know whats the IC reference for the EPROM on the PCB.
 * There is a photo of the CP-450 disk controller unit at: https://datassette.org/softwares/tandy-trs-color/cp-450-basic-disco-v-10

-fmtowns: fixed 16-bit color scrolling a bit more [r09]
 * After further testing, it seems Vain Dream uses the horizontal adjust registers in 16-bit color mode for a small part of the

-dp8510: new device [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * An implementation of the National Semiconductor DP8510 BITBLT Processing Unit. This is used on the InterPro GT family graphics
    boards, and this implementation seems to be correct enough to enable me to progress there, hence the PR. While I'd love to have
    another system to test against, I'm not aware of any other systems that ever used this device other than some NatSemi reference
    designs, which are not (yet) in MAME.

-ibm_5170.xml: Added Quantum Ontrack Disk Manager and one of the disks for Lotus 1-2-3 R3. [Curt Coder]

-RF5C400: Converted to use device_rom_interface [smf]

-Rewind feature and RAM savestates. [vadosnaprimer]
 * This starts the work requested in #2398.
 * How RAM states work.
 * Implemented using util::vectorstream. Instead of dumping m_save.m_entry_list to file, it writes them as binary to vectorstream.
    Compression is not used, as it would slow down the process. The header is written as usual, also in binary. When a state is
    loaded, the savestate data gets binary-read from vectorstream.
 * How rewind works.
 * Rewind is optional, it can be turned off through MAME GUI while not running. Rewind capacity is available there too. Rewind step
    hotkey is available from the standard hotkey menu. In the debugger you have the "rewind" command ("rw" shortcut) that works the
    same as the hotkey.
 * Every time you advance a frame (pause step), rewinder captures a RAM savestate of the frame you were at. It does the same when
    you do step into/over/out in the debugger. Every time it captures a new state (and when you unpause), it marks as invalid all
    its states that go after the current machine time, because input might change, so they are not relevant anymore. It keeps their
    buffers allocated though, for future use. When rewinder runs out of allowed amount of savestates it can have, it invalidates the
    first state in the list and tosses its unique_ptr to the end of the list, then it uses its buffer to capture a new state. When
    you hit the rewind step key, or use "rewind" command in the debugger, it loads a state that is immediately before the current
    machine time. Invalid states between valid ones are not allowed to appear, as that breaks rewinder integrity and causes
    problems. Rewinder keeps its own set of ram states as a vector of unique_ptr's. All rewinder operations and errors get reported
    using machine().popmessage().

-icount was missing from the savestates [vadosnaprimer]
 * When you load a state, icount (*icountptr) would remain whatever it was before loading, messing with the remaining cycles and
    with the amount of code executed per run() call. This introduced non-determinism and badly influenced usage of savestates while
    debugging. machine().time() would also return wrong values after that, since it adds remaining cycles.

-dumped Internal rom from an Oversea (English) region "Oriental Legend 2" cartridge confirming only the region byte changes in that
 case.  [Jeremy Romine, Peter Wilhelmsen, Morten Shearman Kirkegaard]
 * Other regions, including Japan single PCB need confirming to see if there are further changes in those cases or not.
 * As the Oversea version ignores the Card Reader MCU we can mark it as working, so

-Fix Batrider's audio CPU clock. [Alex Marshall]
 * Was doing a repair today that required me to hook up a different clock source to the YM2151, so we tried to use the Z80's clock.
    Turns out, it's not at all 4MHz, so it was wrong. We put the 32MHz oscillator and the Z80 clock on an oscilloscope and
    determined the Z80 clock was divided by 6 instead of 8. So instead we divided the 68k's clock by 4 and got 4MHz, so the 68k is
    indeed 16MHz.

-trs80m2kb.cpp: Added missing keyboard controller rom [Edstrom, Sean Riddle]
 * I sent my fried (don't ask) 8021 trs80m2 keyboard controller to Sean who decapped it (see
    https://seanriddledecap.blogspot.se/2017/12/blog-post_8.html) and visually dumped the bits and after fixing a few bit errors the
    rom now runs in MAME without crashing. I disabled the keyboard device again as there are issues with 8021 emulation, there are
    some 8021 specific instructions that seems to be unemulated at this point: https://i.imgur.com/P5gIySR.png and there are more
    work to be done to replace the generic keyboard in the trs80m2 driver.

-Update of Mybrain 3000 Graphics still needs refactoring before machine is considered working but quite useful already.
 [JoakimLarsson]

-Driver for HP2645A terminal Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR introduces the driver for HP2645A terminal. It's still WIP but the basic system is there. The most important things
    missing:
 * The UART (so you can play with terminal in local mode only ATM)
 * The support for alternate character sets (math symbols, big characters & line drawing)
 * Hopefully I should have some time over the holidays to work on the driver.
 * If you want to run the built-in self test, map the "TEST" key to something (I'm using F9) and press it.
 * I'm going to send the ROM set to the usual "code" e-mail.
 * Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-Rewind implementation fixes and improvements [vadosnaprimer]
 * Reset scheduler savestate to what it was for years before rewind. Changing saved variables should be done after thorough testing.
    Right now, adding some vars breaks some machines, adding other vars breaks others.
 * Switch to megabyte-wise capacity. Savestate size greatly differs between machines, relying on state count is unstable.
 * Switch to internal indexing. No longer depends on inaccurate machine time.
 * Rewind accelerator key in debugger (Ctrl+F11).
 * Report capacity hit (once), with some useful info.
 * Make error reports saner. On any error, basic complaint is posted to emulator window and debugger, details go to error.log. Since
    timers are no longer dumped on every state operation, error.log is no longer getting spammed.
 * Mention rewind and rewind_capacity in the docs.
 * I'm really hoping to get this merged before feature freeze, because it fixes the rewind bugs that make it unstable. I'll be
    around until then, please report if any fixes are still needed. Probably it could also be set to On by default (docs would need
    to be tweaked too).

-Added preliminary NEC PC-FX softlist [RalfVB]

-pc_vga.cpp: CRTC start address is supposed to be shifted left by 2, from 86Box [Melissa Goad] Fixes #2954 [MoochMcGee]

-fmtowns: fix gaps in flipped sprites When I implemented half-size sprites I made a slight miscalculation that causes them to be
 misaligned if the flip bits are also set, creating "gaps" in, e.g. the initial view of the plane in After Burner. This fixes it by
 keeping the end coordinates fixed and modifying the start ones if the sprite is downscaled + flipped. [rzero9]

-alphatpx: identified more keys [helwie44], added P30 ROMs and labels [rfka01]

-fmtowns: fix kana input and identify missing keys This change adds support for the flags that identify the keyboard layout being
 used. For the time being I have hardcoded it as a JIS keyboard, since it's the more well-known layout and used also in other
 popular computers like the PC-9801. [rzero9]
 * The "right" way to do this would be to let the user select the keyboard layout in some way, but I am still too unfamiliar with
    the MAME internals to implement it.
 * With this change, hiragana mode now produces the expected characters (previously they wouldn't match either of the keyboard
    layouts, and some keys didn't work) and it's possible to input Japanese text normally.
 * Additionally, I have identified and labeled all keys on the JIS keyboard layout with all the possible combinations, as they
    appear on an actual keyboard.

-myb3k: WIP adding ISA bus, cards, devices and branded clones This is work in progress based on Ericsson step/one Service Manuals, a
 branded Mybrain 3000 [JoakimLarsson]

-New prom for In Your Face [dink]

-Revert "Command to print all debugger help to html file" Reverts mamedev/mame#2926 [cuavas]

-alphatpx: Add sound, add Alphatronic P2U and move its ROMs there, split concatenated ROMs in preparation for proper ROM naming and
 fix ROM copypaste errors, update comments. [rfka01]

-fmtowns: implement sprite rotation This change implements sprite attribute bit 14. This swaps the X and Y coordinates and allows
 for sprite rotation in 90 degree increments, by combining it with the mirroring bits. [rzero9]
 * Fixes most (but not all) graphical glitches in After Burner 1 and 3.
 * As with the half-size attributes, rotation of 16-bit color sprites is untested as I haven't found any test cases yet.

-dumped internal rom for kof98umh igs036 [Morten Shearman Kirkegaard, Peter Wilhelmsen] (game boots, but not yet working properly,
 MAME hangs during attract, also needs screen mode registers finding) [DavidHaywood]

-Fix Batrider's audio CPU clock. Was doing a repair today that required me to hook up a different clock source to the YM2151, so we
 tried to use the Z80's clock. Turns out, it's not at all 4MHz, so it was wrong. We put the 32MHz oscillator and the Z80 clock on an
 oscilloscope and determined the Z80 clock was divided by 6 instead of 8. So instead we divided the 68k's clock by 4 and got 4MHz,
 so the 68k is indeed 16MHz. [trap15]

-Add calcune.cpp to arcade.flt [sjy96525]

-Command to print all debugger help to html file Chapter links are sorted. [vadosnaprimer]
 * The current code generated this file: https://vadosnaprimer.github.io/debughelp.html
 * Also tweaked static_help_list spacing to always pad commands and never pad explanations. Not sure about the macro though.
 * rst file could be generated in a similar way, might try that later.

-pgm2: memcard reader now uses image_device stuff, cards can be inserted / removed and get saved [Metallic, David Haywood] promoted
 China set of Oriental Legend 2 to working promoted Knights of Valour 2 New Legend to working [DavidHaywood]
 * as each game/region requires a valid default card in order to save said cards are part of romset.
 * (there's probably a cleaner way to do the device finder stuff but I forgot and can't find reference)

-fmtowns: implement half-size mode for sprites This change implements attribute bits 10-11 for sprites, which enable half-size
 rendering. The exact algorithm is unknown (AFAIK), so I'm just rendering alternate pixels / lines. [rzero9]
 * Documentation on the sprite attribute bits comes from the "FM Towns Technical Databook" by Noriaki Chiba.
 * It fixes some graphical artifacts in arcade ports that simulate sprite scaling like After Burner, Galaxy Force 2, Turbo Outrun
    and such. Also fixes the menu text in Azure, and possibly other things.
 * Note that half-size 16-bit color sprites are untested, as I don't know of any test cases.

-Trigger a fatal error when console was asked but the console plugin not found. In absence of the console plugin, the option entry
 was not found in m_plugins, making the set_value() crash when deferencing the result of get_entry(). [Mokona]

-agat7: 840KB floppy HLE; minor fixes -> mark WORKING [shattered]

-pgm2: use sprite decryption keys uploaded by games where we have internal rom [MetalliC, David Haywood]

-pgm2 : use uploaded tables for kov2nl / orleg2 [David Haywood]

-fmtowns: fixed mouse cursor moving on its own in Data West games This change fixes a bug that caused the mouse cursor to move
 downwards on its own in some Data West games (Misty, Psychic Detective series, The 4th Unit series). These games seem to poll the
 mouse port in a peculiar way that caused the reads to return 0x0f sometimes even if the user wasn't moving the mouse. [rzero9]
 * It doesn't break anything in other games or in TownsOS / Windows, as far as I have tested.

-Added 'Prototype' to ibm5170_cdrom More info about the game > http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/prototype [RalfVB]

-Added 'Sideline' Added 'Sideline', probably the best sidescrolling shoot 'em up for DOS, and also one of the most obscure. The game
 has been declared freeware. More info here > http://sideline.ghegs.com/ [RalfVB]
 * I've converted the bin/cue to a chd which can be downloaded here > http://www.mediafire.com/file/pd1utz71px292bs/sideline.chd
 * Some extra info: To run the game, you'll need to run INSTALL.BAT on the disc first. Next run SNDSETUP from the installation
    directory to configure sound cards. To play, run MAIN.EXE from the disc.

-explain the rewind command in debughlp also fix a typo in the stateload description [vadosnaprimer]

-dumped Internal rom from an Oversea (English) region "Oriental Legend 2" cartridge  [Jeremy Romine, Peter Wilhelmsen, Morten
 Shearman Kirkegaard] dumped Internal rom from an Oversea (English) region "Oriental Legend 2" cartridge confirming only the region
 byte changes in that case.  [Jeremy Romine, Peter Wilhelmsen, Morten Shearman Kirkegaard]
 * Other regions, including Japan single PCB need confirming to see if there are further changes in those cases or not.  This is in
    progress.
 * As the Oversea version ignores the Card Reader MCU we can mark it as working, so

-Rewind feature and RAM savestates. This starts the work requested in #2398. Rewind is also on @mmicko's roadmap. [vadosnaprimer]
 * ### How RAM states work.
 * Implemented using `util::vectorstream`. Instead of dumping `m_save.m_entry_list` to file, it writes them as binary to
    `vectorstream`. Compression is not used, as it would slow down the process. The header is written as usual, also in binary. When
    a state is loaded, the savestate data gets binary-read from `vectorstream`.
 * ### How rewind works.
 * Rewind is optional, it can be turned off through MAME GUI while not running. Rewind capacity is available there too. Rewind step
    hotkey is available from the standard hotkey menu. In the debugger you have the `rewind` command (`rw` shortcut) that works the
    same as the hotkey.
 * Every time you advance a frame (pause step), rewinder captures a RAM savestate of the frame you were at. It does the same when
    you do step into/over/out in the debugger. Every time it captures a new state (and when you unpause), it marks as invalid all
    its states that go after the current machine time, because input might change, so they are not relevant anymore. It keeps their
    buffers allocated though, for future use. When rewinder runs out of allowed amount of savestates it can have, it invalidates the
    first state in the list and tosses its `unique_ptr` to the end of the list, then it uses its buffer to capture a new state. When
    you hit the rewind step key, or use `rewind` command in the debugger, it loads a state that is immediately before the current
    machine time. Invalid states between valid ones are not allowed to appear, as that breaks rewinder integrity and causes
    problems. Rewinder keeps its own set of ram states as a vector of `unique_ptr`'s. All rewinder operations and errors get
    reported using `machine().popmessage()`.
 * ### icount
 * Since rewinder fully depends on accurate machine time, using it during debugging uncovered a bug in savestates that causes
    non-determinism. I fixed that with a one-liner, savestates created in the past are not going to work anymore.

-fmtowns: fixed 16-bit color scrolling a bit more After further testing, it seems Vain Dream uses the horizontal adjust registers in
 16-bit color mode for a small part of the intro, and PR #2881 made it slightly worse. This should make both it and psydet5 display
 correctly. [rzero9]

-HLE of HP9845 internal printer Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR adds the high-level emulation of hp9845-series internal printer. It also fixes a couple of things broken by the recent

-fmtowns: correct scrolling in 16-bit color mode Final fix for scrolling / positioning issues (hopefully). Fixes Psychic Detective
 Vol. 5. [rzero9]

-fmtowns: even better horizontal scrolling This is an improvement on PR #2873 that takes into account the scaling factor of the
 graphics layers. It improves scrolling on titles like 38man (intro), azure (title screen), and probably more. [rzero9]
 * Hi-color mode is just a guess, though. I'm not sure if there is any software that actually uses the scroll registers in this mode
    so it may not be completely right.

-Update strings.po translated 45 strings 👍 [theheroGAC]

 * I doesn't seem to break anything else, as far as I have tested.

-fixing/improving metadata on CoCo FDCs: CP-450 and CD-6809 Thanks to Daniel Campos & Datassette.org for the CP-450 disk rom. MAME
 was calling it CP400_FDC, but the correct name of the disk controller unit is "Prológica CP-450". The ROM was correct (verified
 checksum), but I renamed it to fix the previous naming mistake. Unfortunately this FDC unit is rare, so I still don't know whats
 the IC reference for the EPROM on the PCB. [felipesanches]
 * There is a photo of the CP-450 disk controller unit at: https://datassette.org/softwares/tandy-trs-color/cp-450-basic-disco-v-10

-Update for Brazilian Portuguese Minor fixes and typos. Added @felipesanches requests Shorted some strings as @felipesanches
 requests, not all "IU" was changed because it breaks the interface or is too long. We will have to deal with the "parent" and
 "clone" thing later, maybe the use of RAMIFICAÇÃO (RAMIFICATION OF) that will better reflect with our Language. [katananja]

-Prodigy webinterface poc This is just a 1-to-1 mapping of the subset of features used by the Prodigy layout so far. The XSL
 stylesheet transforms the LAY XML to SVG and also inserts necessary javascript code to set up a web socket connection to the
 Prodigy driver. Only the key pad and the BCD display works atm The internal UI is in sync with the web UI at all times.
 [JoakimLarsson]
 * The code is quite driver independent and could be moved and refactored to go into the webserver core parts to provide SVG support
    to any layout based driver, if that is the route we wanna take. I don't suggest this as a replacement of the internat UI but
    instead a complement to add SVG style driver UI:s when needed. Additional SVG elements needs to be added to the LAY file
    vocabulary that will be ignored by the internal UI. It would also be possible to convert the LAY file  once to SVG and go from
    there.
 * Another idea is to write an XSL stylesheet transforming to WebGL meshes given that dimensions can be described in the LAY file.
 * Lastly, there is nothing that prevents this UI to be served over Internet, very little needs to be changed for that except for
    A/V encoders for screens and audio that needs to be added.

-Update Dutch translations Good afternoon from The Netherlands! [mourix]
 * Added all the new strings, fixed some grammar and spelling mistakes. Should be all complete again.

-Update for Brazilian Portuguese [katananja]
 * All translation updated to follow GNOME Translation Rules for Brazilian Portuguese, this are the same rules followed by other
    Linux Distributions, Manuals, etc. Now we can avoid translation conflicts. http://br.gnome.org/GNOMEBR/ErrosFrequentes
    http://br.gnome.org/GNOMEBR/GuiaDoTradutor
 * Brazilian Portuguese REQUIRE context, it doesn't matter what a word say, we need to see what the program is doing instead of what
    the word/phrase is saying to construct the phrase correctly.
 * That ROM AUDITION functions means nothing in Brazilian Portuguese, so the translation was adapted to "Condição", this reflects
    better if the ROM is GOOD/BAD, etc.
 * OK has different meanings in Brazilian Portuguese, if you ask someone if the food was good and you reply "OK", it means that the
    food  are between good and bad or more or less. Since "Ok" doesn't reflect if the ROM is good or not, the translation was
    changed to "BOA" witch means "GOOD" following Brazilian Portuguese concordance rules "Estado dA ROM" this "A" tell us to use
    "boA" (female) instead of "BOM"(male).
 * Some parts of the translation was also adapted to fit the screen or the space the phrase is at.
 * To our language, the correct translation to plugin is plug-in.
 * A few more mistakes were fixed like Enter (to type in) = Digite not "Entre" (to get inside of) or Search = Pesquisa not "Busca",
    etc.
