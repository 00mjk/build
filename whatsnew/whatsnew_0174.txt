Source Changes
--------------
-chdman.cpp: fix for code that expects to be able to dereference a
 pointer that it knows may be null [Vas Crabb]

 [Brizzo, MetalliC]

-a5200: fixed regression when loading headerless carts from fullpath.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-neogeo.cpp: huge clean up of the cartslot code in order to better 
 exploit slot devices: [Fabio Priuli]
 * moved cart-specific components to the carts itself removing the
    fake protection devices from the main system, since they never
    belonged there
 * removed hacky rom region destruction/construction when a new cart
    is inserted, replacing it with proper bank pointers to the carts
    (except for ymsnd and ymsnd.deltat region which will require
    modernization of the ym devices)
 * started re-organization of bootleg boards emulation, so to reduce
    the need of collapsing everything into a single cart type with
    multiple protection devices, more work is needed

-neopcb.cpp: moved to a separate source file the emulation for JAMMA
 PCB versions of a few neogeo games, since they don't have a cartslot. [Fabio Priuli]

-neogeo.xml: added information about Japanese titles and release dates
 to the software list and aligned the list to the driver. [Fabio Priuli]
