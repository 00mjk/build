 * Too many changes to describe in detail. A rewrite of the interrupt and dma code in the ioga, and fixes to the cpu and mmu were
    the most important things.

-nscsi: add support for CD-ROMs with 512-byte blocks (#3727) [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * nscsi: add support for CD-ROMs with 512-byte blocks
 * Older UNIX workstations used SCSI CD-ROM drives with 512-byte logical blocks instead of the now standard 2048. This change makes
    the block size configurable, and adds logic to translate logical blocks to/from the underlying 2048 byte sectors as needed.
 * add support for 512-byte logical blocks
 * logmacro.h logging (turned on by default to retain current behaviour)
 * added stub for "prevent/allow medium removal" command
 * removed some unnecessary state
 * minor fix for nscsi_hd "inquiry" command

-devcb3 [Vas Crabb]
 * There are multiple issues with the current device callbacks:
 * They always dispatch through a pointer-to-member
 * Chained callbacks are a linked list so the branch unit can't predict the early
 * There's a runtime decision made on the left/right shift direction
 * There are runtime NULL checks on various objects
 * Binding a lambda isn't practical
 * Arbitrary transformations are not supported
 * When chaining callbacks it isn't clear what the MCFG_DEVCB_ modifiers apply to
 * It isn't possible to just append to a callback in derived configuration
 * The macros need a magic, hidden local called devcb
 * Moving code that uses the magic locals around is error-prone
 * Writing the MCFG_ macros to make a device usable is a pain
 * You can't discover applicable MCFG_ macros with intellisense
 * Macros are not scoped
 * Using an inappropriate macro isn't detected at compile time
 * Lots of other things
 * This changeset overcomes the biggest obstacle to remving MCFG_ macros altogether.  Essentially, to allow a devcb to be
    configured, call .bind() and expose the result (a bind target for the callback).  Bind target methods starting with "set" repace
    the current callbacks; methods starting with "append" append to them.  You can't reconfigure a callback after resolving it.
    There's no need to use a macro matching the handler signatures - use FUNC for everything.  Current device is implied if no
    tag/finder is supplied (no need for explicit this).
 * Lambdas are supported, and the memory space and offset are optional. These kinds of things work:
 * .read_cb().set([this] () { return something; });
 * .read_cb().set([this] (offs_t offset) { return ~offset; });
 * .write_cb().set([this] (offs_t offset, u8 data) { m_array[offset] = data; });
 * .write_cb().set([this] (int state) { some_var = state; });
 * Arbitrary transforms are allowed, and they can modify offset/mask for example:
 * .read_cb().set(FUNC(my_state::handler)).transform([] (u8 data) { return bitswap<4>(data, 1, 3, 0, 2); });
 * .read_cb().set(m_dev, FUNC(some_device::member)).transform([] (offs_t &offset, u8 data) { offset ^= 3; return data; });
 * It's possible to stack arbitrary transforms, at the cost of compile time (the whole transform stack gets inlined at compile
    time).  Shifts count as an arbitrary transform, but mask/exor does not.
 * Order of mask/shift/exor now matters.  Modifications are applied in the specified order.  These are NOT EQUIVALENT:
 * .read_cb().set(FUNC(my_state::handler)).mask(0x06).lshift(2);
 * .read_cb().set(FUNC(my_state::handler)).lshift(2).mask(0x06);
 * The bit helper no longer reverses its behaviour for read callbacks, and I/O ports are no longer aware of the field mask.  Binding
    a read callback to no-op is not supported - specify a constant.  The GND and VCC aliases have been removed intentionally -
    they're TTL-centric, and were already being abused.
 * Other quirks have been preserved, including write logger only logging when the data is non-zero (quite unhelpful in many of the
    cases where it's used).  Legacy syntax is still supported for simple cases, but will be phased out.  New devices should not have
    MCFG_ macros.
 * I don't think I've missed any fundamental issues, but if I've broken something, let me know.

-ef9365: Clear framebuffer memory on reset. [Nigel Barnes]

-PowerVR2: implement color [snickerbockers]
 * PowerVR2 represents color using two components: a base color and an optional offset color.  The base color is combined with the
    incoming texture sample (if any) according to the fixed-function specified by the tsinstruction in the per-polygon parameters,
    and then the offset is added to this color (with the exception of alpha; the offset color has an alpha component but it does not
    appear to ever be used).
 * The base color and offset color can be specified on a per-vertex basis (as either a group of four 8-bit integers or a group of
    four single-precision floating points) or they can be specified on a per-polygon basis (in floating-point only) and then scaled
    based on per-vertex scalar values (also floating point).

-mc146818: support direct-access bus hookup method. [R. Belmont]
 * This chip has 8 address/data lines and an address/data strobe.  Most users hooked it up so the low-order address bit is the
    address/data strobe, allowing you to write an address and then read/write data at an adjacent address.
 * But if you don't mind using a few more gates you can latch the low-order address bits from the CPU into the chip then latch the
    data in or out of it so it works just like a RAM.  The MIPS DECstations did this in their I/O ASICs.

-decstation.cpp: added more devices, now runs enough to give an interactive PROM monitor. [R. Belmont]

-Allow per-device internal layouts and remove some more MCFG_ macros. Input and screen tags are now resolved relative to a layout's
 owner device. [Vas Crabb]
 * Easy way to demonstrate is with: mame64 intlc440 -tty ie15
 * Previously you'd only get the IE15 terminal's layout and you'd be unable to use the INTELLEC 4/40 front panel.  Now you'll get
    the choice of layouts from both the system and the terminal device in video options.

-pc88va.xml: add new dump This is my own dump of Tetris for the PC-88VA, taken from an original 5.25" disk. The PC-88VA driver
 doesn't work, of course, but I'd like to document it anyway in case something happens to the original disk or my computer. [rzero9]
 * It seems to have some kind of protection on track 1 side 0 (I see some non-standard sector IDs, variable sector sizes, and wrong
    CRCs) so I thought the HxC MFM format would be the safest choice.

-Add new ST floppy dump I'm separating out all hardware from #3324 so as to make it easier for it to progress. [FakeShemp]
