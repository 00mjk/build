 * Serves linked HTML pages for machines, devices, and source files.
 * Demonstrates how to dynamically discover slot/BIOS options from static -listxml output.
 * Allows user to build a slot configuration and shows necessary command-line arguments or INI lines to produce it in MAME.
 * As a side effect, this provides additional validation of -listxml output, several issues and limitations were addressed.

-Fixed -sleep and -refreshspeed options, fixed a stupid forced unnecessary sleep. [Vas Crabb]

-Fixed -slot card,bios=rev (selected BIOS was being applied to slot itself, not card). [Vas Crabb]

-Fixed up input merger: added more variants, synchronisation and save state support, removed dubious reset behaviour. [Vas Crabb]

-Removed a whole lot of I64 from format strings (use logerror/string_format/stream_format to avoid it). [Vas Crabb]

-Added validation of BIOS names/descriptions/defaults and fixed errors exposed. [Vas Crabb]

-Moved additional content for release archive from build repository to main repository. [Vas Crabb]

-namcos2.cpp: Ordyne uses older IO MCU ROM, cleaned ROM labels as per PCB photos. [MetalliC]

-gaelco3d.cpp: Increased TMS ROM region, makes Football Power players models visible; better Football Power ball mechanic
 simulation, promoted to working. [MetalliC]

-Added Atomiswave security notes. [brizzo, MetalliC]

-gb.cpp: optimize the channel update methods. [057a3dd61f99517a3afea0051a49cb27994f94d]
 * I recently noticed that it takes very long to load a gba state, sometimes dozens of seconds, and the older the state is, the
    longer it takes to load.
 * I found out it's caused by gameboy_sound_device does not save the m_last_updated variable, and after loading a state, in the
    update_state method, now could end up being much larger than m_last_updated, and leads to substantial yet wasted calculation of
    the channel state.
 * Simply adding save_item(NAME(m_last_updated)) should fix the problem, however, since it will break current existing saved states,
    and optimize the channel update methods is in the TODO list, I took the latter choice, now the calculation to update the channel
    state is really negligible and the state loading is almost instantaneous.

-gb.cpp: save m_last_updated and m_snd_control.cycles [057a3dd61f99517a3afea0051a49cb27994f94d]
 * These two variables are added later but not saved, however, since they are used in the update_state method to control how many
    cycles to feed to the channel update methods, they should be saved to ensure correct emulation.

-Road Runner (Midway): replaced bad rom with good one, added notes [Credits to be determined]

-Cleanup/bulletproofing to the issue Wizz just found [Nathan Woods]

-Imgtool:  Changed a pointer to a reference, and fixed a std::string(nullptr) bug [Nathan Woods]

-Imgtool: Proper cleanup of floppy object after create/open failure [Nathan Woods]

-New 74LS259/9334/CD4099 devices [AJR]
 * These humble 16-pin logic devices were commonly used in 8-bit arcade games to control coin counters/lockouts, IRQ flipflops,
    graphics banking, slave CPU reset lines, discrete audio triggers, screen flipping, serial EEPROMs and much else. Over 100
    drivers and a few bus devices have been updated to use the new implementation, and a great deal of research has gone into
    documenting the physical location of these devices on actual PCBs in the source. Write handlers have been provided for both
    orthodox and somewhat less conventional memory mappings.
 * Incidental to this update, coin counters and/or lockouts have been added to Atari System 1 games, Basketball, Gauntlet, Gyruss,
    Hana Yayoi, Hole Land, Jr. Pac-Man, Mahjong Sisters, Pooyan, Roc'n Rope, Squash, Thunder Hoop, Time Limit, Time Pilot '84 and
    many others. This also cleans up coin counter behavior in Sauro and Rally Bike.

-segae.cpp: Corrected rom names for Transformers System E. [Fabrice Arzeno]

-changed set names for 'grtesoro' sets to 'play2000' to more accurately represent the name of the game gave it it's own machine
 structure and memory map instead of borrowing Maniac Square one added some workarounds so that it actually boots, it might not be
 heavily protected compared to the Gaeclo titles and there doesn't seem much chance of us finding a working one. fixed GFX rom
 loading for the game based on above work. [David Haywood]

-ms0515: add sound, change clock rate to real one [Sergey Svishchev]

-ym2151: Emulate reset line [AJR]

-multipcm: confirmed as Yamaha YMW-258-F.  [any, R. Belmont]

-spcforce: Add coin counters, start lamps and addressable latch device [AJR]

-tankbatt: Improved handling of sample triggers (fire sound is no longer doubled) [AJR]

-decocass.cpp: Major improvements to colors and graphics layer priorities [AJR]
 * Implement the PRI2 pen modification effect. This makes the tunnels and headlight in Highway Chase look much more accurate, and
    makes some color changes work in Astro Fantasia.
 * Shadow color in Skater is now properly black (not a pen modification effect).
 * Correct background fill color, making high score screen in Super Doubles Tennis properly blue.

-gt64xxx: Buffer multiple writes for PCI stall.  Fixes MT 06636 (calspeed). [Ted Green]

 * Incorporates change from Z80DART to Z80SIO proposed by Edstrom. Also make UCSD Pascal boot again.

-mario: Add coin counters and 74LS259 [AJR]

-isbc8630: Add 74LS259 "status register" (only partly implemented) [AJR]

 background in Ghox, which was also MCU related [Team Caps0ff]

-blazeon, wingforc: Shadowing RAM with ROM in sound CPU map can't be right [AJR]

-v25: Make IDB register state visible to debugger [AJR]

 * Better documentation for midvunit wheel board
 * Added part numbers

-Added a very preliminary PC9801 AMD98 sound board emulation [Angelo Salese]

-Looking at attract mode, graphics rom 39 is obviously bad. The 32/33 & 38 match the combined 3m rom in cawing, so I extracted 39
 from that. [smf-]

-Refactor server_{ws,http}.hpp into separate interface and implementation. (#2548) [Christian Brunschen]
 * Refactor server_{ws,http}.hpp into separate interface and implementation headers. When shutting down the HTTP server, also
    explicitly stop the asio::io_context.

-mjelctrn, mjembase, majxtal7, neruton: Change CPU type to TMPZ84C015 and improve interrupt handling [AJR]

-dynax.cpp: Use address map bank device for most games in this driver (plus htengoku). Many of these games will now successfully
 retrieve the local time at the start through an RTC device previously treated as read-only. [AJR]

-alphatro: support 8K carts from the command line + add cart software list [R. Belmont]

-fixeight: EEPROM fixes [AJR]

-Delay data capture timing for MSM5205 and MSM6585 (should help with synchronization later) [AJR]

-namcos1.cpp: Fixed joystick dropping inputs bug for crouching/running actions in Beraboh Man [Angelo Salese]

-Update mos6526.cpp [David Viens]
 * Some new demos and song uses CIA1/CIA2's timer values and serial shift register as code to execute! In order to properly debug
    what is doing on one needs the debugger to _see_ at least some of those values, hence the "if
    (machine().side_effect_disabled())" on select registers only.

-Fix to MameTesters bug #6657 (#2560) [npwoods]
 * The source of the issue is that the logic for rotating slot options was broken.  It would count selectable options and skip over
    options that were not selectable, except for the specific scenario where the index was zero.  I ended up largely replacing the
    logic to be more C++-ish.

-fmtowns_cd.xml: add several entries, update undumped list [r09]
 * Added software list entries from various sources:
 * Nihon Mukashibanashi, The Queen of Duellist Gaiden Alpha Light [yukin / Tokugawa Corporate Forums]
 * DOR Special Edition '93 (alt), Gokko Vol. 03 - Etcetera [redump.org]
 * Europa Sensen, Nobunaga no Yabou - Bushou Fuunroku, Inindou - Datou Nobunaga [Reuental]
 * Also, updated the undumped list and merged the Towns and Marty list, since there is no real distinction between them. Some games
    are Marty-compatible, but only some of them were advertised as such, and there are no Marty-only games.

-fmtowns_flop.xml: add several entries [r09]
 * Added Illusion City and Ving Software Collection, both from yukin (Tokugawa Corporate Forums).

-labyrunr.cpp: fixed tile-sprite priorities, mostly visible when exiting an area in most stages. [Angelo Salese]

-new machines promoted to WORKING - TH Strikes Back [David Haywood, Kevin Eshbach]
 * note, if you have old nvram file delete it or you won't see any improvement.

-deco32.cpp: rewritten interrupt handling [Angelo Salese]

-deco32.cpp: improved lightgun support for Locked N Loaded [Angelo Salese]
 * it's now possible to actually play the game to some extent assuming you recalibrate the guns by holding both service buttons.
    Game randomly crashes tho so not yet markable as working.

-irem_cpu.cpp: add some infos about the Superior Soldiers sound CPU [caius]

-mario.cpp: identified marioj as Revision C [Corrado Tomaselli]

-hp85: implemented tape drive [fulivi]

-add basic device for saturn_cdb to load the roms. [David Haywood]

-hiscore.dat: Updates [Leezer]

-New working clone - WWF Superstars US rev 6 (and renamed sets to make more sense), New working clone - 1943 Japan original.  I have
 a pristine original 1943 Japan - when comparing BM01 to the existing MAME BM01 it's clear the existing set has been hacked to
 remove protection.  Renamed that set appropriately. [Bryan McPhail]

-Update om6502.lst [David Viens]
 * Now passes Lorenz testsuite-2.15's cputiming.prg (and does not break laxay.prg) Ref: NMOS 6510 Unintended Opcodes no more secrets
    (v0.91 - 24/12/16) http://csdb.dk/release/?id=152327 page 14 ($BF) cycles = 3 to read, and 4+1 if page boundary.

-igs011.cpp update [Luca Elia]
 * Decrypted vbowlhk and added its own bitswaps for IGS003 and IGS011
 * Found dips to perform a protection test in vbowl. Changed IGS012 mode toggling to pass the test.
 * Changed IGS003 command 48 in lhb2 and vbowl to potentially work in more cases (based on lhb2 tables)

-alphatro: added BIOS set for machine w/Bicom graphics [Team Europe, rfka01, R. Belmont]

-unkfr belongs in 4enraya (which was my guess when it was mentioned) (#2572) [David Haywood]
 * unkfr belongs in 4enraya (which was my guess when it was mentioned) doesn't seem much point in having a complete non-working
    driver in the source for it when it boots as a romswap.

-chanbara.cpp: identified sprite flip X (player sword thrusts) [Angelo Salese]

-dectalk.cpp: fixed firmware 1.8 to use different dsp rom from firmware 2.0, and some driver cleanup [Lord Nightmare]

-Fixed a bug in gap detection of DC100 tape emulation Hi, this PR is for a small fix to DC100 cassette emulation (used in HP 9845 &

-att4425: new skeleton (AT&T 4425 / Teletype 56D text terminal) (take 2) Updated after review in

-new drivers for "Control ID x628" fingerprint-reader and for the NT7534 LCD controller [felipesanches]

-m68340: Added implementations for VCO clock synthesizer and Timer module Counters, IRQ:s and one operational mode. I intend to add
 the serial module and also refactor the modules as devices, moving the whole implementation from machine to cpu/68000 similar to
 the h8 derivates. But that will not be the next thing I do so feel free to review and merge this now, there are a number of other
 drivers that awaits more 68340 functionality apart from the dbox driver I am working on. [JoakimLarsson]

-aristmk5 updates (from Heihachi_73) fixes some sets, adds honeypot and venicea5 [DavidHaywood]

-Fixed MameTesters bug #6621 [npwoods]

-unkfr belongs in 4enraya (which was my guess when it was mentioned) doesn't seem much point in having a complete non-working driver

 [plgDavid]

-add basic device for saturn_cdb to load the roms seems to make more sense than just sitting on the ROMs, which as far as I can tell
 benefits absolutely nobody... [DavidHaywood]

-Emulation of HP85 tape drive Hi, [fulivi]
 * this set of commits adds the emulation of HP85 tape drive. This computer had a HP custom chip (whose part number was 1MA6-0001)
    as tape controller. In order to add the 1MA6 emulation, I first separated the support for the HTI tape format into a proper
    module under "lib/formats". Support for this format was previously embedded into TACO driver (tape controller of HP9845) and the
    related imgtool module. It is now independent of any hw driver or support tool.
 * Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-Adding Alex Kidd in Miracle World 2 Fan made release, which runs in original system and was also released and (limited) distributed
 as a physical copy. More info: https://youtu.be/6ntwR94J6iM https://goo.gl/9efrGv [Shideravan]

-Added several entries to FM Towns softlists See commits for details. [rzero9]

-Update mos6526.cpp Some new demos and song uses CIA1/CIA2's timer values and serial shift register as code to execute! In order to
 properly debug what is doing on one needs the debugger to _see_ at least some of those values, hence the "if
 (machine().side_effect_disabled())" on select registers only. [plgDavid]

-Fix to MameTesters bug #6657 The source of the issue is that the logic for rotating slot options was broken.  It would count
 selectable options and skip over options that were not selectable, except for the specific scenario where the index was zero.  I
 ended up largely replacing the logic to be more C++-ish. [npwoods]
 * I also changed the options list to be std::map instead of std::unordered_map.  Rotating the latter is indeterminent.

-Adding #include <cctype> This seems to be necessary for MSVC to get std::tolower() [npwoods]

-didact: Updated LOG support to latest cut [JoakimLarsson]

-Refactor server_{ws,http}.hpp into separate interface and implementation. Refactor server_{ws,http}.hpp into separate interface and
 implementation files. [cbrunschen]
 * Use std::weak_ptr from websocket_connection_impl to webpp::Connection to avoid reference cycles.
 * When shutting down the HTTP server, also explicitly stop the asio::io_context; this allows the built binary to exit cleanly.

-fix MT 06644 [DavidHaywood]

-Better documentation for midvunit wheel board Found manual with schematics and it all fits well. Couldn't find any jeds for the
 PALs however, so had to work backwards for them. [Risugami]

-misc housekeeping / one-liners [DavidHaywood]
 * removed am already dumped game from the undumped list in balsente.cpp
 * change copy+pasted comment in hangzo to better reflect that the tiles are not encrypted
 * fixed typo in ghox memory map

-Imgtool:  Classic Mac:  Made the logic for B&W icon able to handled non-masked set pixels [npwoods]

-Imgtool:  Fixed features.supports_geticoninfo [npwoods]

-Added NES carts information I've been extended the information in the NES game list with some games I own. Although I have kept the
 dates in the game list, they vary in my games, so they may need to be changed: [inigomartinez]
 * Super Mario Bros.: The date in my cart's PCB is 1986 instead of 1987.
 * Super Mario Bros. 2: The date in my cart's PCB is 1988 instead of 1989.
 * Trog!: The date in my cart's PCB is 1986 instead of 1991.
 * I have also uploaded some images of Pinball that verify the information that has been added.
 * Finally I followed the current rom naming from the game list, as I did in #2537 with SNES, and again, strictly speaking and
    looking at the labels on the carts, shouldn't the names be in uppercase?

-Added SNES carts information The following information has been added to the SNES game list: [inigomartinez]
 * Dragon Ball Z - Super Gokuu Den - Kakusei Hen: Chip names on the PCB layout have been added. Also the rom name has been fixed by
    renaming it to the proper program name. I kept the date in the game list, which is the date in the cart label (1995), though the
    date in the PCB label is different (1993).
 * Ranma ½: I have added information of an earlier Ranma ½ revision, dated 1992 instead of 1993. It uses two roms as program roms,
    which could be 2Mb each summing up 4Mb like the 1993 version, or 1Mb U1 and 512Kb U2 like the French version. I have tried to
    find information about the ROM chips without any success. I have also added the chip names on the PCB layout.
 * Donkey Kong Country 2 - Diddy's Kong Quest: I have added information of an earlier Donkey Kong Country 2 revision. The current
    dump is SPAL-ADNP-1, while this car is SPAL-ADND-0. It uses SNSP-AxyD-suffix as product code which actually is not documented in
    the Europe's catalogue product code. I kept the date in the game list, thought the cart label has 1992 as date, and the PCB has
    1993. I don't know which one is the correct one. I have also kept the `cart_revision`value as A, though I don't know how to
    check it, and the program ROM size, which I suppose will also be 4Mb.
 * Pilotwings. The information on my cart matches the one in the game list, though the `serial` and `cart_back_label` values are
    different as the cart corresponds to the spanish market. I have also added the proper `CIC` type.
 * The new Ranma ½ and Donkey Kong Country 2 - Diddy's Kong Quest are commented as `Pending` until the information can be verified.
 * Finally I followed the current rom naming from the game list, though strictly speaking and looking at the labels on the carts,
    shouldn't the names be in uppercase?

-SAM6883: Fixed a bug by which VDG addressing incorrectly honored the page bit This affected the CoCo/Dragon family of drivers
 [npwoods]
 * Special thanks to Ciaran Anscomb for identifying this problem

-add HD647180X MCU dumps to Whoopee and Ghox  [Team Caps0ff] This adds  HD647180X MCU dumps to Whoopee and Ghox, allowing for sound
 emulation in both of them. It also fixes the high score table background in Ghox, which was also MCU related [Team Caps0ff]

-[Imgtool] C++-ification of imgtool_forkent structure [npwoods]

-Imgtool:  Eliminated Imgtool-specific rand() function [npwoods]

-Rainbow-100: use Z80SIO instead of Z80DART; make UCSD Pascal boot again Incorporate change from Z80DART to Z80SIO proposed by
 Edstrom. Also make UCSD Pascal boot again. [Bavarese]

-ms0515: add sound, change clock rate to real one [shattered]

-revert the speed fix in Galaxia/Astro Wars that caused all sets to sound wrong The present S2636 core has been rewritten more than
 a year ago by Vas to adapt the tone frequency from the refresh rate, and this made me realize that my speed fixes for galaxia.cpp
 were incorrect. [kazblox]

-changed set names for 'grtesoro' sets to 'play2000' to more accurately represent the name of the game [DavidHaywood]
 * gave it it's own machine structure and memory map instead of borrowing Maniac Square one added some workarounds so that it
    actually boots, it might not be heavily protected compared to the Gaelco titles and there doesn't seem much chance of us finding
    a working one. fixed GFX rom loading for the game based on above work.

-gb.cpp: optimize the channel update methods. I recently noticed that it takes very long to load a gba state, sometimes dozens of
 seconds, and the older the state is, the longer it takes to load. [057a3dd61f99517a3afea0051a49cb27994f94d]
 * I found out it's caused by gameboy_sound_device does not save the m_last_updated variable, and after loading a state, in the
    update_state method, now could end up being much larger than m_last_updated, and leads to substantial yet wasted calculation of
    the channel state.
 * Simply adding save_item(NAME(m_last_updated)) should fix the problem, however, since it will break current existing saved states,
    and optimize the channel update methods is in the TODO list, I took the latter choice, now the calculation to update the channel
    state is really negligible and the state loading is almost instantaneous.
