-drawgfx: Make the palette optional [O. Galibert]
 * device_gfx_interface does two things:
 * go from a possibly weird rom layout to a one-byte-per-pixel tiled layout
 * draw the tiles so created
 * The second part requires a palette, but the first doesn't.  And low-level emulations of individual graphic chips (konami tilemap
    or sprite generators for instance) are not supposed to care about the palette.  They just output bits which are partly indexes
    into palettes, and partly not, and in any case become pen ids only much further in the rendering chain.  But they need access to
    the decoding step, because one-byte-per-pixel is real nice..  So now such a device, which inherits from device_gfx_interface,
    can call set_palette_disable(true) and no palette tag will be required. Calling the draw functions will segfault though.
 * As a side effect, the gfx_element constructor now takes a palette pointer instead of a reference, since it's now optional.

    device_memory_interface; correct region lengths

-hh_sm510: Improved Mickey & Donald SVG artwork [Sean Riddle, RColtrane]

-Improve CD audio play track/index command handling [smf]  (#2337) [Angelo Salese]
 * (kokoroj2 needs mods in the MB89352 core that won't break x68k as well. kokoroj2 requires the printer interface: a command to
    stop current track is sent with CD & printer disabled in dip-switches. As for x68k, installing HumanOS on HDD fails with current
    too so there's a lot of fun factor here)

 Fixed prebillian vblank input so game doesn't hang with real MCU dump,
 fixed player 2 spinner input, and added ball launch 'button' [Lord Nightmare]

-s2650: I/O modernization [AJR]
 * Replace fake S2650_SENSE_PORT address with line read callback (set_input_line should also work). There are still some doubts
    regarding whether VBLANK should be inverted in various drivers.
 * Replace fake S2650_CTRL_PORT and S2650_DATA_PORT addresses with... well, these aren't dedicated parallel ports, so they actually
    haven't gone away. They have, however, been moved to a new 1-bit address space, since the ports share the main data bus and are

-new working clone Lock'n'Chase (DECO Cassette) (Japan) [??]
 * this is in various public rom collections, and even on MAMEdev, but was never added? looks like a 100% legitimate Japanese
    version, complete with the alt (harder) maze.

-the following exist in the public 'various arcade' collection too ?! again no idea who to credit, this stuff was just forwarded to
 me. [David Haywood]

-accomm: Fully implemented keyboard [Nigel Barnes]
 * Added sound (same as Electron)
 * Added layout and hooked up Caps/Shift Lock LED's

-ti99: Added new cartridge type paged7 for TI-CALC. [Michael Zapf]

-new working clones  Treasure Island (DECO Cassette) (Region D) [David Haywood]
 * this is the ctisland3 set that has been in MAME since forever.  compared to the other ctisland sets it uses a different
    encryption and has a region code of 'D' in the header. we haven't seen any 'D' region roms before (A is Japan, B is assumed to
    be US) so I've had to handcraft a bios rom for it (the only difference between the A/B bios roms is the single byte it checks in
    the header anyway)

-new NOT WORKING  Game Prince RS-16 [BeckieRGB]
 * boots to menu, some games are playable

-hp9k_3xx updates: [arbee]
 * Preliminary working DIO/DIO-II bus implementation and 98544 video card

 * Support medium-res built-in video on 9000/332

-added diagnostic 7-seg led [pmackinlay]

-Gameboy v7 Some miscellaneous game boy documentation updates and a simple constant initialization as reported by coverity.
 Additionally, I converted the mbc1 collection check to compare the whole game title instead of only checking select bytes (probably
 came from GoodGBX). [Tauwasser]

-use dumped M68705 for fieldday / undoukai [ShouTime, brizzo]

-various small improvements, no breakthroughs Please note fixes to ncr5390 and ncr539x logging [pmackinlay]

 momentary per actual game [palazzol]

-Fixed JVC disk format to correctly recognize 2 sided disks. And also included an additional #include to let the build system know
 about the new SDF format. [tlindner]

-use more likely clocks for littlerb based on PCB XTALS (Main CPU is more likely 8MHz than 12Mhz) [DavidHaywood]
 * also use a hack to overclock the TMS to 120% so that the map screen renders properly, points at possible timing errors in the
    core?

-HP9845: improved keyboard mapping & German layout Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR is for a set of changes to HP9845 emulation. I & A.Kueckes have improved the keyboard mapping & added the German layout
    of keyboard. We also added pop-up messages to report the state of the 3 "toggle" keys (AUTOST, PRTALL & SHIFT LOCK) whenever it
    changes. The variants with German keyboard require a different ROM set, I'm mailing them to the usual "code" email. Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-Added read support for the disk format SDF used in the CoCoSDC The CoCoSDC has been around for a while now, with more than 500
 sold. A disk format gaining in popularity. [tlindner]

-Added support for resetting RX interrupts/status by reading Rx FIFO through RR3, gets virtpool driver terminal a bit further but
 not all the way an no visible difference. [JoakimLarsson]

-r9751: Add more SMIOC registers and additional traces [bmunger]

-Improve CD audio play track/index command handling [smf]

-Fix incorrectly labeled machine and add another [AttackedbyGlitch]
 * Rename "Cyber Arcade 120-in-1" to "Defender M2500P 120-in-1". According to the dumper, this would be the correct name for this
    machine.
 * Add vdogdeme, an earlier version of vdogdemo.

  [DavidHaywood]
same hardware as pitnrun, with no MCU populated. [DavidHaywood]
no copyright on the title screen, thought to be by Kaneko. [DavidHaywood]
doesn't look like the original needs rom 5, the bootleg however you can't shoot anything in, presumably they moved some code around
  causing it to need an extra rom? unfortunately the chip on the bootleg was dead. [DavidHaywood]
decryption figured out by ArcadeHacker. [DavidHaywood]
I did a lot of research on this one that I want submit before I loose track of it. The driver is impeded on a lot of devices we
  don't emulate just yet so it will take a while to get it up and running. However I hope to be able to add the LED matrix
  controller for the power up sequence quite soon. [JoakimLarsson]

Bambino Classic Football [hap]
this is the ctisland3 set that has been in MAME since forever.  compared to the other ctisland sets it uses a different encryption
  and has a region code of 'D' in the header. [DavidHaywood]
we haven't seen any 'D' region roms before (A is Japan, B is assumed to be US) so I've had to handcraft a bios rom for it (the only
  difference between the A/B bios roms is the single byte it checks in the header anyway) [DavidHaywood]
this is in various public rom collections, and even on MAMEdev, but was never added? [DavidHaywood]
looks like a 100% legitimate Japanese version, complete with the alt (harder) maze. [DavidHaywood]
