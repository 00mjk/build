-Changed Air Combat 22 auto-centring throttle from Pedal to AD_STICK_Z. [sjy96525]

-drawgfx: Make the palette optional [O. Galibert]
 * device_gfx_interface does two things:
 * go from a possibly weird rom layout to a one-byte-per-pixel tiled layout
 * draw the tiles so created
 * The second part requires a palette, but the first doesn't.  And low-level emulations of individual graphic chips (konami tilemap
    or sprite generators for instance) are not supposed to care about the palette.  They just output bits which are partly indexes
    into palettes, and partly not, and in any case become pen ids only much further in the rendering chain.  But they need access to
    the decoding step, because one-byte-per-pixel is real nice..  So now such a device, which inherits from device_gfx_interface,
    can call set_palette_disable(true) and no palette tag will be required. Calling the draw functions will segfault though.
 * As a side effect, the gfx_element constructor now takes a palette pointer instead of a reference, since it's now optional.

-MT 06594 [Robbbert]

-[Ram Device] Better detection of bad -ramsize strings, move some private code to anonymous namespace (#2336) [Nathan Woods]
 * [Ram Device] Better detection of bad -ramsize strings, move code to anonymous namespace
 * There was a longstanding bug where '-ramsize 16kfoo' would be treated as '-ramsize 16k'

 * (kokoroj2 needs mods in the MB89352 core that won't break x68k as well. kokoroj2 requires the printer interface: a command to
    stop current track is sent with CD & printer disabled in dip-switches. As for x68k, installing HumanOS on HDD fails with current
    too so there's a lot of fun factor here)

    the header anyway)

decryption figured out by ArcadeHacker. [DavidHaywood]
I did a lot of research on this one that I want submit before I loose track of it. The driver is impeded on a lot of devices we
