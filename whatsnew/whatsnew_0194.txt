-didact.cpp: split out of Candela computers in its own driver for clarity [Joakim Larsson Edstrom]

-arm7: revert previous changes, explicit masking and rotating was unneeded (except for POP {Rlist} which is correct), handle v5
 behavior (lsb address bit is ignored in 16bit loads) in arm946es_cpu_device::arm7_cpu_read16 instead, manually handle v4 and v5
 difference for LDRSH signed halfword load. [MetalliC]
 * note: it looks like all? v5 cores ignore least significant address bit during 16bit loads, so we should add something like
    virtual uint32_t arm7_cpu_read16(uint32_t addr) override { return base_class::arm7_cpu_read16(addr & ~1)}; into theirs class
    declaration.

-Added new preliminary/skeleton driver for Odyssey (Silicon Gaming) [Roberto Fresca]

-fmtowns: refactor line drawing, support zoom up to x16, better wrapping [r09]
 * Refactored the line drawing code to make it less repetitive and more flexible.
 * Added support for all 16 horizontal zoom levels supported by the hardware instead of just 5. As far as I know this is only used
    in some Data West games (Misty, Rayxanber)
 * Simplified the line wrap detection code and support all use cases (including vertical scrolling and layer 1 with sprites).

 [Vas Crabb]

-pgm2.cpp: dumped internal firmware for kov3 [Peter Wilhelmsen, Morten Shearman Kirkegaard] not: FPGA comms emulation required,
 currently hacked out. [MetalliC]

-kov3: default sram, speedups, visible area fix [David Haywood]

-Add verbose logging for CFG files (#2980) [Firehawke]
 * Basic anchor links for FAQ page
 * Add verbose logging for CFG files
 * We already have verbose logging for INI files that get parsed, so having CFGs get similar treatment is useful.

-fmtowns: fix single-layer 16 bit mode and multipage wrapping [r09]
 * Doubled line size when in single-layer + high color mode. Software that uses this combination (secre2, debut2, ayayo123 "X68000
    version") now looks mostly correct.
 * Made the line wrapping code aware of VRAM page selection. Fixes a small number of cases where half of the screen would "shake"
    without this check.

-fmtowns: fix misplaced bottom lines [r09]

-ymz770.cpp: docs update and cosmetics, no actual impact on emulation [MetalliC]

-Update sorcerer_cass.xml (#2986) [Michael Borthwick]

 segadimm.zip [smf]

-vamphalf: improve mdig speedup, it appears to be faster and works for drc & interpreter, remove "space" calls, use e132xs state
 enum instead of magic numbers. [smf]

-Route16 : simulate protection [iq_132, Robbbert]

-pgm2.cpp: emulate kov3 ROM module communication, remove hack. probably should be devicified later. [MetalliC]

-csplayh5.cpp: redumped nuretemi's sound ROM [ShouTime, The Dumping Union]

-c65.cpp: added some hw notes, corrected CPU clock [Guru]

-Fix Two Issues with the glsl Bilinear Shader [Aaron]
 * 1. Off-by-one pixel coordinates 2. Sampling of wrong pixels at some non-integer stretch factors
 * First was noticed while comparing screenshots of the software and opengl w/glsl renderers (opengl output was shifted up and to
    the right). Fixed by subtracting a 1/2 pixel from the texture coordinates when calculating the bottom left pixel to use for
    interpolation.
 * Second was apparent when running pac-man fullscreen on a 1920x1080 screen and allowing non-integer stretching. Manifested as
    irregular horizontal 'steps' in the output. Fixed by sampling from the center of all pixels which should avoid any funny
    business in regards to pixel coordinate rounding.

-Add Bicubic Shader to OpenGL Backend [Aaron]
 * This shader uses the equation described by R. Keys in the paper 'Cubic Convolution Interpolation for Digital Image Processing'
    which is, in this case, the same as a Catmull-Rom spline. This produces a sharper upscaled image than bilinear filtering.
 * The new shader is selected by setting gl_glsl_filter to 2. Consequently, gl_glsl_filter is now treated as an int rather than a
    boolean.
 * Also fixed a variable name problem in the code guarded by GLSL_SOURCE_ON_DISK.

-ygv608.cpp: Fix a small graphics glitch in RALLY-X Arrangement [Agiri]

-vg5k: Removed reference to VG-5000µ default ROM (CRC a6998ff8), making the "alternate" (CRC 57983260) the correct one. [S. Glaize]
 * ROM was dumped from a Philips VG-5000µ and compared to the "alternate" (CRC 57983260) version to find it was the same.
 * Analyze of the (CRC a6998ff8) and why it is faulty and useless to keep:
 * Address $1000: correct instruction is DI ($F3) at start of boot; in faulty ROM, the instruction is INC BC ($03), which makes no
    sense here.
 * Address $2000: this is the start of the table pointing to BASIC instructions. It is matched with the table at $209e containing
    the keywords. The first keyword (END) will cause the first address to be decoded (at $2519 to $2525) and executed. Correct
    address is $2f3a, address found in the faulty ROM is $2f00, thus preventing END instruction to work.
 * Address $3000: this part is the code for the NEXT instruction, starting at $2fe4. The faulty ROM at $3000 causes a CALL $CE02,
    which is out of the memory range and leads to reboot with no RAM extension. With RAM extension, as the ROM is copied during the
    memory test at boot, it causes a Syntax Error. The correct byte at $3000 is $03, leading to a CALL $0302, which is correct.

-fmtowns: fix vsync flag read from port cff86, Birdy Soft games now boot [r09]
 * According to the FM Towns Technical Databook, when reading from port 0xcff86, bit 4 should always be set and bit 2 is the VSYNC
    flag. With this change, Birdy Soft games (cal, myeyes, beast3...) boot instead of getting stuck in a loop waiting for the flag.

-mac: added 1.3 ROM to BootBug card [Al Kossow]

-pgm2: various updates (#3001) [David Haywood]

 [hap]

-fmtowns: implemented hsync read from cff86, later 4th Unit games now boot (#3002) [r09]
 * fmtowns: implemented hsync read from cff86, later 4th Unit games now boot
 * Similar to PR #2999, the later games in the 4th Unit series (zero, dagain, merrygor, wyatt) were getting stuck waiting for the
    HSYNC flag from 0xcff86 (bit 7). With this change they run past the initial menu.
 * (this is largely copied from Barry's implementation for port 0xfda0, so credit goes to him)
 * fmtowns: replaced machine().first_screen() with m_screen

 * Removed debug testing code.
 * - Allow loading of built-in layouts even if override_artwork is specified.
   - Allow loading of fallback_artwork if only default view have been found.
   - Fixed order of built-in layouts with regards to fallback_artwork as agreed upon the forums.

-Move Multipcm bank schemes to DEVICE_ADDRESS_MAP The real Multipcm(Yamaha YMW258-F) chip may not have any internal banking(and not
 have panning-related banking), so I move bank schemes to device address map. Fix Multipcm Banking for Sega Multi32 Games ex.
 Outrunners : This game uses Multipcm with Full 0x1800 Byte header for 512 samples, and 2 512KB Bank area for sound samples.
 [cam900]

-Overhaul commandline section of docs, includes index with linkable anchors. This is a substantial overhaul of the old commandline
 section. [Firehawke]
 * I found all options that were duplicated across SDL and Windows-specific sections and merged those with careful attention to note
    what parameters are valid per-OS.
 * Additionally added a new index page for commandline options that should be useful for providing support.
 * While I did do my absolute best to make sure no errors crept in, the sheer size of this means it's entirely possible I may have
    missed something. I didn't see anything obvious at a quick glance, in any case. As always, let me know and I'll do corrections
    as needed.

-Improved Nitro Ball priority / alpha mixing rohga : remove outdated comments. [cam900]

-various reorganization of radica and vtech stuff this is a re-synced version of the previous PR as changes in master meant that no
 longer compiled. (these are all TV game and similar Epoxy blob system related changes) [DavidHaywood]
 * -
 * split radica6502 driver up into multiple files
 * devices now reside in their own files
 * split vtech geniusiq driver up into multiple files
 * several of the sets in here weren't even 68k based and need to have their CPUs identified properly
 * added driver for VTech Reader Laptop E
 * we know what CPU die this is, but don't know what it's copied from, if anything.
 * correct parent/clone status of a number of sets in vii.cpp
 * also marked vii as NOT WORKING as over half the games just give you a black screen and always have.
 * elevated the Radica TV Games that were in the Megadrive softlist to be proper MAME sets
 * they're standalone consoles, no need to treat them as fake cartridges anmore
 * and..
 * new machine marked as NOT WORKING : Radica Golden Tee Golf Home Edition [Sean Riddle]

-r9751: Add keyboard input queue and add CBX OS stack tracing [bmunger]

-fmtowns_cd.xml: replace 3dgolfha floppy with proper dump When initially dumping the floppy disk for New 3D Golf Simulation I didn't
 realize that it had some kind of copy protection on track 2, so it didn't actually work. [rzero9]
 * This replaces it with a new dump in HxC MFM format, converted from KryoFlux raw files. It's enough to let the game recognize the
    system disk as original and start the user disk creation process as expected.

-Get rid of nonbuffered_palette_w at decocomn backfire.cpp : Palette cleanup deco156.cpp : Get rid of unused functions, nw
 cninja.cpp : mutantf : Add MCFG_SCREEN_RAWS dassault : Add MCFG_SCREEN_RAWS, Demote Thunder Zone/Desert Assault with
 MACHINE_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS, because blending effects aren't fully emulated [cam900]

-Split Data East ACE Chip Emulation ACE chip(Data East 99) used on: boogwing.cpp (Boogie Wings / The Great Ragtime Show(Japan))
 deco32.cpp (Tattoo Assassins / Night Slashers) ACE Chip is alpha blend/palette effect functions, but many unknown things.
 Registers: Byte 0x00-0x1f: alpha control value (0x0:opaque, 0x10:half transparent, 0x20:fully transparent, 0x21~:unknown) Byte
 0x20: fadeptred Byte 0x21: fadeptgreen Byte 0x22: fadeptblue Byte 0x23: fadestred Byte 0x24: fadestgreen Byte 0x25: fadestblue Byte
 0x26: fadetype (0x1100:multiplicative, 0x1000:additive, 0x0000:normal, other:unknown) Byte 0x27: unknown [cam900]
 * The 'ST' value lerps between the 'PT' value and the palette entries.  So, if PT==0, then ST ranging from 0 to 255 will cause a
    fade to black (when ST==255 the palette becomes zero). 'fadetype' - 1100 for multiplicative fade, 1000 for additive.
 * Logs: boogwing: Get rid of decocomn, Hooked up ACE Chip, improvement alpha blendings, implement color fade effects (at
    transporter stage, end of each level, "DANGER" effects, and some flashing effects) deco32(Tattoo Assassins / Night Slashers):
    split ACE Chip emulation to mame/machine source, implement palette additive fading

-misc small bits (grudge, nesvt, kickgoal) Default FreePlay DSW to 'Off' for the recently added 'grudge' parent set (Free Play
 doesn't work properly on it anyway) Leave it to 'On' for the previous set because Coin mode doesn't work properly there
 [DavidHaywood]
 * Add a note about (undumped) Majesco Frogger TV game likely being nes_vt
 * Did some cleanups to the Kick Goal driver and added a new clone.

-Radica 6502: some hacks to improve the video, lack of test cases / makes these tricky to figure out properly [DavidHaywood]
 * hopefully more games using this hardware will surface to supply more evidence.

-new WORKING machine : Last KM (Ver 1.0.0275) [Asociación Retroaccion, Ricardo Puerto]]

-Radica6502 : Added scrolling for Phoenix, enemy placements are a mess tho [DavidHaywood]

-Add initial support for new VTxx handeld, SY-889 This adds initial support for the SY-889 handheld I dumped recently, which uses
 some one of the VTxx enhanced-NES chips. The exact chipset is unknown and doesn't resemble any other VTxx system - as well as
 software differences, it uses QSPI flash instead of the parallel flash used by all other known VRT chipsets. Credit to
 NewRisingSun2 who helped with the reverse engineering. [daveshah1]
 * At the moment the ROM will run, the colours are correct (the chipset uses a different palette format to the VT03, storing colours
    as RGB555), but there are serious graphical glitches on the intro and when the menu scrolls. Most of the games seem to run OK
    though. I think this is because of the scanline interrupt timing being off.
 * Reverse engineering thread: http://s4.zetaboards.com/PGC_Forums/topic/30178284/1/

-radica 6502: preliminay sprites [DavidHaywood]

-Add additional memory operators per request (NW) Per request, added some info on other memory operators. Also cleaned up the text
 formatting a bit further on expressions. [Firehawke]

-Correct command heading case and adjustments to expressions (NW) Per request, adjust case of commands. [Firehawke]
 * Additional small tweaks to the expressions section as well.

-First pass of MAME Debugger help for documentation. (NW) Here's the first pass of debugger help for the documentation LOOSELY based
 on PR #2948. [Firehawke]
 * Some help text grammar has been corrected and will be backported back to the help command inside the debugger after the
    documentation version (this) is cleaned up sufficiently.
 * Known issues:
 * There's no help for the history command. I need to work out what to do about that yet, but I didn't want it to delay getting the
    basics in.
 * There's still a little bit of "wall of text" in some descriptions. I'll be cleaning those up.
 * There SHOULDN'T be any glaring errors in here, but I could have missed something. As always, drop me a note if I need to change
    anything. This includes formatting-- if you really dislike the formatting, get in touch with me and we'll work something out.

-Radica6502 : use palette selection bits in 4bpp mode, format still wrong tho. [DavidHaywood]

-radica6502: better emulation of the video hardware, [DavidHaywood]

-Various progress on the Radica 6502 stuff of note, what appears to be the tilemap mode register found. [DavidHaywood]

-radica 6502 tvgames: identify where gfx are coming from in each of the games in the space invaders pack so we can attempt to find
 the register that controls it, or dma etc. [DavidHaywood]

-Mark ti83p, ti83pse, ti84p, and ti84pse as NOT_WORKING These are not functional, and should be flagged as such. [jlachniet]

-Some legacy floppy fixes and cleanups When the legacy floppy code is used for lookups and the tags are not the expected ones it
 will default to the first drive. Since atarifdc has the drives below the "fdc" the generic lookup function could not be used.
 Making a copy of this is definitely ugly, but this is legacy code anyways and it fixes it. There's also some other drivers with
 legacy floppy support that did it this way. [firewave]

-fmtowns: fix cdrom regressions This fixes a regression introduced with commit 81f44e1e968b559330a0c9cefebcef0868e1e9f4 that caused
 some games that were working previously (e.g. Emerald Dragon, several Cocktail Soft games, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) to
 fail to boot. [rzero9]
 * Everything that Carl's commit fixed (e.g. Shadow of the Beast 2, Ultima IV/V, Loom, etc.) is also working, so hopefully this
    should make everyone happy.

-restored SANITIZE make option I didn't test it with "thread" yet, that's why there's still a part of the commented code left.
 [firewave]

-Mybrain 3000,JB-3000,Ericsson PC step/one feature complete for main unit and the 5.25" QD FDC ISA card. The video support is HLE
 and misses interlaced modes as the MC6845 doesn't perform well for these modes at the moment but most softwares uses color mode or
 the 640x200 monochrome mode. This PR adds: [JoakimLarsson]
 * a step/one softlist with the 5.25" disks [Mattis Lind]
 * keyboard interrupt [Fredrik Öhrström]
 * keyboard support specific for each brand/clone [Fredrik Öhrström]
 * Centronics printer support
 * Cursor support
 * 36x25, 40x25 and 80x25 char modes
 * 320x200 8 color, 640x200 monochome and a semi working interlaced 640x400 monochrome mode
 * Color and Monochrome monitors
 * RAM sizes of 128Kb and 256Kb
 * We still lack a jb3000 bios dump but myb3k and stepone drivers are promoted to WORKING in this PR

-Improvements to HP2645A Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR adds support for the following features to HP2645A terminal emulation:
 * RS232 I/O
 * Multiple character sets (line drawing, big characters, math symbols)
 * Option switches
 * Beeper
 * The terminal can be used "out of the box" as long as you map the "REMOTE" key to something and press it (or else the terminal
    will stay in local mode by default).
 * I'm going to send the updated ROM set to the usual "code" e-mail.
 * Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-alphatpx: Add HSYNC callback This allows the P2 series machines to continue to their MOS monitor and boot disks. [rfka01]

-didact.cpp: addressed review comment [JoakimLarsson]

-Sound reference input [ajrhacker]

-Added asserts for index out of bounds [firewave]

-hook up sound in black touch '96 [David Haywood] and yes, I think it is meant to sound this awful, playing the coin sound
 repeatedly when you'd expect a typewriter sound.. [DavidHaywood]

-Updates "2017" strings to "2018" where relevant. Updates "2017" copyright string to "2018" where relevant, based on pull request
 #2017. [jonathanholt]

-fmtowns: fix missing pixels in single-layer modes This change fixes two issues that only happen with software that uses the
 single-layer mode (PMODE bit = 0). [rzero9]
 * In 16-bit color mode, if pixels in VRAM have the alpha bit enabled, it's ignored by the video hardware and drawn to the screen
    anyway. This fixes the character dialogue in the Towns port of Hatchake Ayayo-san Pro-68k.
 * 256-color mode can only be enabled as a single layer, so pixels with palette index 0 aren't transparent and need to be drawn.
    This fixes black "spots" in Yami no Ketsuzoku and wrong colors in the Genocide Square FMVs.
 * Along with this, I have simplified the towns_crtc_draw_scan_layer_256 function by removing the layer 1 drawing code (which is
    never executed).

-blackt96 - fix pickup colours [DavidHaywood]

-pgm2 / arm9 : ensure savestates work from commandline (eg launching with -state 0) also tag driver as supporting states.
 [DavidHaywood]

-fmtowns: implemented hsync read from cff86, later 4th Unit games now boot Similar to PR #2999, the later games in the 4th Unit
 series (zero, dagain, merrygor, wyatt) were getting stuck waiting for the HSYNC flag from 0xcff86 (bit 7). With this change they
 run past the initial menu. [rzero9]
 * (this is largely copied from Barry's implementation for port 0xfda0, so credit goes to him)

-pgm2: various updates [DavidHaywood]

-fmtowns: fix vsync flag read from port cff86, Birdy Soft games now boot According to the FM Towns Technical Databook, when reading
 from port 0xcff86, bit 4 should always be set and bit 2 is the VSYNC flag. With this change, Birdy Soft games (cal, myeyes,
 beast3...) boot instead of getting stuck in a loop waiting for the flag. [rzero9]

-pgm2: handle MSB of zooming, used by kov3 [DavidHaywood]

-kov3: treat this bit as 'sprite disable' - prevents stray horemen heads in kov3 attract also changes what you see in the shop
 (improves, hopefully, I can't read Chinese) [DavidHaywood]

-Removed reference to VG-5000µ default faulty ROM (CRC a6998ff8) making the"alternate" (CRC 57983260) the correct one. [Mokona]
 * ROM was dumped from a Philips VG-5000µ and compared to the "alternate" (CRC 57983260) version to find it was the same.
 * Analyze of the (CRC a6998ff8) and why it is faulty and useless to keep:
 * Address $1000: correct instruction is DI ($F3) at start of boot; in faulty ROM, the instruction is INC BC ($03), which makes no
    sense here.
 * Address $2000: this is the start of the table pointing to BASIC instructions. It is matched with the table at $209e containing
    the keywords. The first keyword (END) will cause the first address to be decoded (at $2519 to $2525) and executed. Correct
    address is $2f3a, address found in the faulty ROM is $2f00, thus preventing END instruction to work.
 * Address $3000: this part is the code for the NEXT instruction, starting at $2fe4. The faulty ROM at $3000 causes a CALL $CE02,
    which is out of the memory range and leads to reboot with no RAM extension. With RAM extension, as the ROM is copied during the
    memory test at boot, it causes a Syntax Error. The correct byte at $3000 is $03, leading to a CALL $0302, which is correct.

-pgm2: fixed fg tilemap size (fixes kov3 boss death sequences) [DavidHaywood]

-ygv608.cpp: Fix 'COLOR TEST' in ND-1 self test A few printf shows R#13(m_border_color) is written when entering ND-1 self test.
 It's just a guesswork, but this change fixes 'COLOR TEST' screen in test mode. [agiri-san]

-ygv608: Add mosaic effect for Galaga Arrangement Ending/Staffroll In Namco Classic Collection vol.1, mosaic effect is used in
 Galaga Arrangement Ending/Staffroll scene. This patch adds emulation of the effect. [agiri-san]

-GLSL Bilinear Filter Fixes and Add Bicubic Filter Hi! [webghost009]
 * I've made a couple of fixes to the glsl bilinear filter and added a new bicubic glsl filter. I've done this for my own personal
    use but want to offer the changes to the project. I've separated the fixes and the new filter into different commits in case you
    want the fixes but not the new shader (assuming you want any of it! :))
 * I also have the bicubic shader implemented for bgfx but do not have a windows machine to generate the DirectX shaders. If you
    would consider merging such a change, I'll setup a VM for that purpose.
 * Below are screenshots illustrating the differences. Of course, a browser is going to do whatever it wants in regards to scaling
    and filtering. I find it easiest to compare by toggling between the before and after shots locally in a viewer I trust.
 * Before and after the bilinear fixes. Note that the text is no longer cut-off at the top. This matches the software and bgfx
    renderer behavior: !pacman_640x480_bilinear_opengl_orig !pacman_640x480_bilinear_opengl_fixed
 * Bilinear and then bicubic, Pac-Man @ 640x480. Generally less blurry. The white text and pellets are brighter due to being
    influenced less by the black surrounding them: !pacman_640x480_bilinear_opengl_fixed !pacman_640x480_bicubic_opengl
 * Bilinear and then bicubic, MK @ 1920x1080 this time. Slightly different screenshots but the floor, wall, and skeletons are static
    and illustrate the difference nicely: !mk_bilinear !mk_bicubic

-Update wd2010.cpp Use calculated access times - typical for MFM drives of that age - instead of hard coded values. [Bavarese]

-Update sorcerer_cass.xml Updated year, publisher and developer for Orb of Halucidon from my original copy of the manual. Updated
 publisher for Air Traffic Controller from my original copy of the manual. [exidyboy]

-fmtowns: fix single-layer 16 bit mode and multipage wrapping [rzero9]
 * Doubled line size when in single-layer + high color mode. Software that uses this combination (secre2, debut2, ayayo123 "X68000
    version") now looks mostly correct.
 * Made the line wrapping code aware of VRAM page selection. Fixes a small number of cases where half of the screen would "shake"
    without this check.
 * The second commit fixes misplaced lines that sometimes appear at the bottom of the screen in some games (e.g. aburner3 intro),
    due to the drawing code going beyond the last line of the layer.

-kov3: default sram, speedups, visible area fix [DavidHaywood]

-Restore buttons 2-3 for Quarth / Block Hole The actual Quarth / Block Hole board allows the use of buttons 2 and 3 as well as 1 to
 fire blocks. Even though they all do the same thing, being able to hit multiple buttons in quick succession is critical for quick
 and accurate play. [Mikejmoffitt]
 * I restored joystick down as well, as the game does scan for it and read it (even though it is only reflected in the test menu).

-Correct Virtua Fighter 2, Behind Enemy Lines Year Virtua Fighter 2 Titlescreen Says 1994 and release year is 1994 confirmed from
 Arcade TV Game List Kokunai - Kaigai Hen (1971 - 2005) at Page 37; Behind Enemy Lines Titlescreen Says 1997 and release year is

-Add verbose logging for CFG files Similar to how .INI file parsing is logged in -verbose, this adds .CFG parsing logging.
 [Firehawke]

-Fix MT#06804 [sjy96525]

-fmtowns: refactor line drawing, support zoom up to x16, better wrapping [rzero9]
 * Refactored the line drawing code to make it less repetitive and more flexible.
 * Added support for all 16 horizontal zoom levels supported by the hardware instead of just 5. As far as I know this is only used
    in some Data West games (Misty, Rayxanber)
 * Simplified the line wrap detection code and support all use cases (including vertical scrolling and layer 1 with sprites).

-Basic anchor links for FAQ page [Firehawke]

-Override and fallback options for artwork I've added a override_artwork and fallback_artwork to the MAME options. This will allow a
 user to override (no other artwork is loaded) the artwork or provide a fallback scenario for artwork. In discussion on the forum,
 the following order was agreed upon: [phulshof]
 * If -override_artwork set: load override artwork, and return when successful
 * Load explicit file, return when single file is set (UNCHANGED)
 * Load driver name (UNCHANGED)
 * Load internal default views (UNCHANGED)
 * Load parent driver (UNCHANGED)
 * Load parent of parent (will find bios artwork, e.g. neogeo for clones of neogeo games)
 * If -fallback_artwork set: load fallback artwork
 * For single screen: load internal horizont or vertical (UNCHANGED)
 * If no layout has been found, load internal defaults based on number of screens (0, 2, 3, 4) (UNCHANGED)
 * As this is to be my first contribution to this MAME repository, please be gentle but firm. :) I would like to learn as much as
    possible, so any and all improvement suggestions are welcome.
