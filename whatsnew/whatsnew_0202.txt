 [Roberto Fresca, Grull Osgo]

-forgot.... [Roberto Fresca]

-vamphalf.cpp: Complete redump of Cool Minigame Collection (Italy) [coolmod, Brian Troha]
 * out of whatsnew: redump removes all BAD_DUMP from rom def. first 6 graphics roms were the same, only the last 2 were different
    for the Italian version.

-new WORKING machines (#3911) [David Haywood]
 * new WORKING machines Pitapat Puzzle [David Haywood, ClawGrip, Brian Troha, The Dumping Union]
 * also fixed up tile banking in the driver which should fix some Bestri bugs

-Add Jongputer support (#3912) [yukaritamura]
 * Add Jongputer support
 * Jongputer was an origin of mahjong video games, developed by Alpha Denshi at 1981. T.T Mahjong by Taito that was already
    supported by mame, and Computer Mahjong by Nichibutsu were licensed variants of the Jongputer.
 * This patch reuses T.T Mahjong's proms to decide palette colors for rendering. This may be inaccurate in terms of emulating the
    real devices, since I could not find relevant proms on the Jongputer's PCB.
 * Also j1 rom placed beside the AY-3-8910 is still unknown. Address pins seems to be managed by counter logic chips, and probably
    this is used to realize pseudo sampling voice, "reach".
 * Jongputer support cleanups
   - BAD_DUMP marks for reused proms
   - Mark T.T Mahjong as a clone of Jongputer
   - Use jongpute instead of ttmahjng since the jongpute is parent now
   - Sort mame.lst entry in the dict order

-lethalj.cpp : Reduce runtime tag lookups, Fix naming [cam900]

-artmagic.cpp : Reduce runtime tag lookups, Cleanup naming etc... [cam900]

-mcr68: mapped 6840 to lower data bits on all mcr68 games, which matches the blasted schematics. I used cswidth as different games
 write at odd or even addresses, even though the boards look visually similar. Byte writes will work in either case as the 68000
 puts the same data on the upper and lower part of the bus. Reads are a mix of odd and even addresses, International team laser and
 spy hunter 2 exclusively read at even addresses. It's unclear whether this is a bug in those games or not. [smf]

-new clone added - River Patrol unprotected [braintro]
 * Out of what's new: This set is verified removes the botched silver land conversion set as the program roms where from the
    unprotected set_entry 9.2t has bad bits, it's replaced with the new dump which matches the bootleg

-new NeoGeo 'sp1-u4' BIOS (from a US, 4-slot) [ack] (#3940) [David Haywood]
 * new NeoGeo 'sp1-u4' BIOS (from a US, 4-slot) [ack]

-Move imperfect graphics flag down into PSX GPU device [AJR]

-psikyo.cpp : Fix rowscroll [cam900]

-galaxian.cpp: Video and timing updates from #3783 [kazblox]
 * Correct sync in Take Off, Explorer, and set 2 of Amigo. Sidam bootlegs of Konami games have a 12MHz pixel clock with video being
    scaled by two pixels instead of 3.
 * Correct Jump Bug background hardware behavior, as per real hardware. Stars actually show up until the 232nd pixel.
 * Correct bullet behavior in Scramble. Shells are now two pixels long, and have been verified on real hardware.
 * Fix(?) clocks on jungsub. The Subelectro 113 board has no XTALs, and I am assuming the CLK lines come from the pixel clock on the
    Konami L-1200-2 board.
 * Given Take Off's hardware hierarchy, correct the year from 1980 to 1981 as a guess.
 * Correct machine setup for Take Off, Explorer, and set 2 of Amigo. All are now correctly set up as per the 12 MHz pixel clock.
 * Mark Explorer and set 2 of Amigo as MACHINE_IMPERFECT_SOUND. Explorer requires the same sound timer as Take Off, which I have no
    idea how it works. The latter probably has a similar case, although it might be different from Explorer.
 * Mark Take Off as MACHINE_WRONG_COLORS. See the reference video for more; some colors that are purple with the default
    palette_init are green on real hardware.
 * Correct background hardware on SF-X and Monster Zero to now show stars and RGB backgrounds. Colors may not be correct, and the
    current schematics scans are not easy to read.
 * Converted galaxian.cpp to use MCFG_SCREEN_VBLANK_CALLBACK.
 * turpins is likely more derived from Super Cobra hardware than Scramble hardware. Change the set description to match this
    statement.

-mandinga: Fix sound by adding sound CPU ROMs from Amidar; mark them as BAD_DUMP. Chances that they may be different are unknown.
 [kazblox]

-huc6230.cpp : Fix PSG, Timer'd ADPCM update, Implement CD-DA Volume (#3919) [cam900]

 * psikyo.cpp : More fixes
 * psikyo.cpp :Minor fix

-sn76496.cpp: rename NCR7496 to NCR8496 for Tandy 1000TX and similar machines based on PCB pictures and service manual parts list;
 add support for PSSJ-3 ASIC used in later Tandy 1000 machines. Fix noise generatior behavior in NCR8496 and PSSJ-3 to match
 hardware tests. [Lord Nightmare, Qbix, ValleyBell, NewRisingSun]

-new clone added [MASHinfo]

-new WORKING clones - Toki no Senshi - Chrono Soldier (MC-8123, 317-0040) [ShouTime] (#3952) [David Haywood]

      [Tomas Garcia-Meras (ClawGrip), Roberto Fresca, Recreativas.org, The Dumping Union]
 * Revert whitespaces
 * Update armedf.cpp
 * Rename fist bootleg Legion set

-interpro: notworking -> networking (#3815) [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * interpro: notworking -> networking
 * These changes combine to make InterPro networking work on Windows with the TAP-Windows6 driver.
 * osdnet: add a receive delay (1 frame) after transmit to avoid a time-travel problem
 * taptun: pad short Ethernet frames and append FCS (Windows-only until Linux taptun behaviour is verified)
 * clipper: fix bugs in carry flag handling, prefer sign bit for tests
 * i82586: fix transmit bug, handle reset
 * networking: delayed transmit/receive
 * A second attempt to fix networking on InterPro systems, by introducing somewhat realistic delays into network transmit and
    receive paths. This version works by adding functions to device_network_interface which enable a device to be informed when the
    transmit or receive completes. The delay is only crudely approximated based on the specified bandwidth and the number of bytes
    being transmitted, but it should be good enough in practice. Existing drivers should not be impacted by these changes;
    overriding the new functions (and no longer overriding recv_cb) is necessary to obtain the new behaviour.
 * Changes from the previous commit:
 * i82586: improve interrupt handling, implement delayed transmit/receive behaviour
 * dinetwork: add transmit/receive delay timers, handlers and logic
 * osdnet: remove receive delay, add the ability to start the receive timer

-yunsun16.cpp : Cleanups Cleanup duplicates, Reduce runtime tag lookups, Reduce unused, Fix notes, Cleanup tilemap scanning [cam900]

-Removed Usagi imperfect graphics flag (#3948) [sjy96525]

 Fix OKI clock related to On-PCB XTAL, Add palette decoder member for palette, Cleanup/fix naming, Fix palette entry, Reduce runtime
 tag lookups [cam900]

-PSX GPU: Added Textured Dot rendering [smf]

-Beast Busters - fix sprite priority [bmcphail]
 * Credit to Daniel Filner for information.
 * Palettes 0xc-0xf on 2nd sprite chip behind the tilemap - confirmed on level 2 and matches real hardware video.  Removed
    imperfect_graphics flags as no open bugs.
 * (question - why is this marked as imperfect audio when there are no notes in the driver or open mametesters bugs?)

-Megatech - add some label info from manual [bmcphail]

-hh_tms1k: Fixed lockups in stopthief, corrected 1 bad bit after double checking the ROM with the decap. Also noted that stopthiefp
 actually works fine already. [Mike]

-seta001 remove a kludge [DavidHaywood]

 * Removed no sound flag from gauntleg12 as I couldn't find any major sound bugs in recent versions.
 * Add imperfect sound flags sf2049 and clones, nbashowt, nbafl, and nbagold (previous flagged as no sound.)

 * sparc: Fixed TBR masking when taking traps and interrupts. [Ryan Holtz]

 * sun4c: Ignore writes to ASIs 12-14, as we do not emulate the cache. [Ryan Holtz]

-powervr2.cpp: store different types of polygons in different lists [snickerbockers]

-powervr2.cpp: make opaque polygons opaque [snickerbockers]
 * Previously, MAME's pvr2 implementation treated all polygons as transparent.
 * This resolves missing graphics in certain games which were rendering opaque polygons with alpha values which would make them
    transparent if they weren't on the opaque list.
 * In the future, Punch-through polygons will also require special consideration. These are polygons which support transparency but
    not blending (every pixel is either entirely transparent or entirely opaque).  For now, they're still treated the same as
    transparent polygons.

-use c68 for more games, fix what looks like more cam900 damage (luckywld) due to bad ram size assumptions. (#3976) [David Haywood]

 * namcos2 / namcos21 - use configured banking for audiocpu

-valtric: Redumped and corrected Text ROM "vt_07.bin" (#3988) [ClawGrip]
 * Text ROM was overdumped (although both halfs were not identical, having two different bytes). The ROM socket on the PCB was
    labeled as "27128", pointing that the new size is the right one.

 * sun4: Fixed MMU page fault handling. SunOS installer now boots. [Ryan Holtz]

-PSX GPU Implement transparent dots & lines (which fixes MT 06528) & declare variables on first use. [smf]

 * More descriptive names for ROMs of latest IOC revision (from Bitsavers)
 * imds: Remove skeleton driver; ROMs preserved as v1.4 of imds2ioc

-split namco c169 roz chip, c123 tilemap chip and c355 sprite chip from namcos2 shared state by making them devices (#3991)
 [David Haywood]
 * some reorganization still needed (eg move init stuff to config)
 * use std::fill instead of memset
 * split out c123 tilemap chip
 * namco system2 sprite chip is a device, move content of machine/namcoic.h to a text file in 'etc' as it's not really code at all,
    and the cpp file is no longer needed
 * Namco System 2 ROZ is a device (so only gets created on games that have it, avoids a crash in old code in tilemap viewer)
 * untangle namcofl from namcos2 now that things are devices
 * untangle namconb1 from namcos2
 * untangle gal3.cpp from namcos2
 * untangle namcos2 and namcos21 - part 1 (ugly part)
 * untangle system2 and system21, part 2
 * use c68 for c68 based games in namcos21.cpp and some cleanup / notes / reorganization / default nvrams
 * c123 - move init to device config
 * c169 init -> device config
 * c355 init -> device config
 * new clones Four Trax (Japan) [ShouTime, The Dumping Union]
 * note, one of the gfx roms in the MAME set has an 'fx2' label, it should be verified.
 * also replaced the ROMs for the fourtraxa set, the old ones had a 0x00 fill instead of a 0xff fill but were otherwise identical,
    it's a weird mod of the World set that hides most of the advertising banners, replacing them with generic ones, presumably for
    legal reasons?

-seta2.cpp: Document undumped Guardians on the P0-113A PCB and provide a PCB layout for the P0-113A PCB [Brian Troha]

 ^. [tim lindner]

-pcx: Make display work again in new resolution [AJR]
 * This includes a workaround for a regression that likely occurred with e39e873875b98ee1cd4a0bc81226a9e56b169497.

-Add Sun mouse port and hook it up to sun3, sun3x, sun4, and sun4c. Also add notes to Sun keyboard emulation. [Vas Crabb]
 * There's a hack to make the 1200 Baud mouse actually run at 9600 Baud. This is necessary because the SCC is incorrectly expecting
    9600 Baud rather than 1200 Baud.  I don't have time to fix the SCC, so I'd appreciate it if someone else would.
 * There's no way it should be expecting 9600 Baud on the mouse port. Solaris 2.3 and later support 1200 Baud and 4800 Baud, and
    earlier versions support 1200 Baud only.  No version of Solaris works with a 9600 Baud mouse.
 * The workaround allows the mouse to be used in SunView on sun4_60 - I haven't tested any other drivers.

-bbcb: Added floppy disc controller options:- [Nigel Barnes]
 * AMS 3" Microdrive Disc System
 * Microware DDFS FDC (not working)

-bbc: Added Acorn Bitstik and Bitstik 2 analogue controllers. [Nigel Barnes]

 * sun4, sparc: Optimized the SPARC core and the sun4 driver. [Ryan Holtz]

-Verified the dump of 5000026.u18 on the very earliest (prototype?) IBM 5160 XT BIOS revision. [MicroCoreLabs]

-Namco System 21 and other related refactors (#4013) [David Haywood]
 * namco checkpoint (including cam900 submission)
 * optional -> required don't use fake bootstrap on older type, suspend CPU instead
 * split namco21 driver into 3 drivers as the different configurations really are entirely different boardsets with similar
    components, not a real 'system' emulated entire PCB set for driveyes (
    http://www.tvspels-nostalgi.com/Bilder/PCB/Namco/driverseye_cage_inside.jpg ) although how the PCBs communicate is not yet known
    (C139 maybe, which might also be an MCU)
 * mark cybsledj as World instead, there's nothing about this set other than the CY1 code to indicate that it's a Japanese set, and
    I don't think the Namco codes represent region, just release order.

-suprnova.cpp: verified plds' dumps [caius]

 * sun4: Added a sun4c MMU device. Currently wraps the functionality of S4-buffer, S4-cache, and S4-MMU, will eventually be split.
    [Ryan Holtz]
 * sun4: Significant optimization, from 150% -> 330% unthrottled on an i7-5930K. [Ryan Holtz]

-vgmplay: added sample player support for SN76496, YM2203 & C6280 [smf]

-correct name for f1superb The correct name for f1superb is "F-1 Super Battle" according to manual and to game title screen. [f205v]

-Namco System 21 and other related refactors note this includes cam900s changes and thus supersedes his submission (
 https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/3999 ) as it was working on the same code. [DavidHaywood]
 * gave an option for tms320c25 to use an internal ROM config (it's controlled by a pin)
 * converted Namco C67 to be a tms320c25 type with internal ROM
 * reorganized and split out the older and newer System 21 DSP boards into their own board devices (this can now be shared with
    Galaxian 3 which has 2 DSP boards identical to the later System 21 one)
 * split out the 3D renderer into a device too (likewise, this will enable us to use it with Galaxian 3)
 * corrected bad documentation (I've contacted owners of 3 Star Blade PCBs and in all cases their boards have been identical to
    Cyber Sled, the configuration previously described does not appear to exist and is not logical)
 * various cleanups (eg suspend the DSP CPU in the earlier S21 type rather than running a dummy program before the 68k uploads to
    RAM)
 * I consider this to be a checkpoint that will serve as the base for futher cleanups (and work on things like Galaxian 3 + the
    proper Drivers Eyes PCB cage setup, which I'll look into soon)

-neogeo.cpp, neopcb.cpp : Eliminate register_postload, Cleanup naming neogeo.cpp : Remove some MCFGs neogeocd.cpp : Cleanup
 regions/naming neogeo_spr.cpp : Fix crash when fix bios is not exists [cam900]

-dsk_dsk.cpp: sectors must be read even if it contains deleted mark FDC will read the data if SK bit is not set. [AmatCoder]
 * Fixes MameTesters bug #07081

-More CoCo driver second level shift work. Implemented this for the coco 1 and 2. Also fixed an omission for the coco3 driver.
 [tlindner]

-tzx_cass.cpp: 1ms pause is always required Not only when pause from block is greater than zero . Otherwise the last pulse is not
 terminated properly in some cases. [AmatCoder]

-CoCo 3 Second Level shift Extended CoCo 3's keyboard to include a second shift level. This enables natural keyboard support for {,
 }, [, ], \, |, _, and ^. [tlindner]

-Make HLSL scanline shader happen before defocus The current behavior in MAME has scanlines rendered after the defocus shader, which
 results in no blurring able to be done to scanlines. This has an odd effect that can be seen when the Y defocus parameter is large.
 This change makes the scanline be rendered first. This allows the scanlines be blurred. At high enough defocus the scanlines will
 lose distinction. [anikom15]

-pacland.cpp: Changed to approach real hardware behavior Currently, when drawing the topmost-sprites, only draw non-transparent
 pixels of fg, but originally it is correct to draw the whole screen. However, it is necessary to keep sprite-sprite priorities
 intact. [kunikunijp]
 * I think that approached the real hardware behavior. Also, I was able to reduce unnecessary bitmap memory area.

-Add missing short commands I've noticed this while I was translating the manual. [katananja]

-split namco c169 roz chip, c123 tilemap chip and c355 sprite chip from namcos2 shared state by making them devices some
 reorganization still needed (eg move init stuff to config) [DavidHaywood]

-Redumped and corrected Text ROM "vt_07.bin" [Tomas Garcia-Meras (ClawGrip), Roberto Fresca, Recreativas.org, The Dumping Union]
 Text ROM was overdumped (although both halfs were not identical, having two different bytes). The ROM socket on the PCB was labeled
 as "27128", pointing that the new size is the right one. [clawgrip]

-wecleman.cpp update info for WEC Le Mans 24 based on PCB pictures update info for WEC Le Mans 24 based on PCB pictures [f205v]

-namcos2 / namcos21 - use configured banking for audiocpu [DavidHaywood]

-Update "getstarb1" Added missing PROMs, update an already added PROM (was different on the PCB), add a PAL as NO_DUMP (protected),
 update ROM labels and verified some ROMs that were corrupt when set was originally dumped
 [Tomas Garcia-Meras (ClawGrip), Roberto Fresca, Recreativas.org, The Dumping Union]

-powervr2.cpp: implement opaque polygons PowerVR 2 treats opaque polygons as a separate class of polygon from transparent polygons.
 Pixels rasterized from opaque polygons are always completely opaque regardless of what their alpha values are. [snickerbockers]
 * This PR resolves missing graphics in games which render opaque polygons with non-opaque alpha values.
 * There's also a third class of polygon called punch-through, which supports transparency but not blending (so every pixel is
    either entirely opaque or entirely transparent).  Those haven't been implemented, and are still being treated as if they were
    transparent polygons.
 * Before: !0001 After: !0000
 * Before: !0007 After: !0001

-use c68 for more games, fix what looks like more cam900 damage (luckywld) due to bad ram size assumptions. [DavidHaywood]

-vegas.cpp various updates Promoting Cart Fury to working status and removing the no sound flag because I couldn't find any major
 bugs from all the recent versions I played this game on. [Hydreigon223]
 * Tested Gauntlet Legends 1.2 in MAME to check if sound works and it does so removed the no sound flag from that. However, 1.2 runs
    slower in MAME than 1.6.
 * Replaced "no sound" with "imperfect sound" for Rush 2049 and NBA Showtime related games. Rush 2049 has obvious sound glitches
    while NBA Showtime has various other issues while sound itself works.

-stage1 namcoc65 / c68 devicification NOT ready for merging yet, cleanups to be done, and I want to pull c68 out and make the
 difference as transparent to the drivers as possible first. [DavidHaywood]

-fix cam900 damage in fuukifg2 / fg3 from May prevents MAME from crashing trying to access tilemap[0x42] instead of tilemap[0x3]
