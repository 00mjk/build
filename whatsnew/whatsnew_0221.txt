-Adding and tidying some C64 tapes (#6511) [Zoë Blade]
 * Add a partial tape, B-side only
 * It's incomplete, but a start.
 * Add a full tape, Hacker II
 * Add partial dump of James Pond 2: RoboCod
 * Add partial dump of Kettle
 * I'm only adding dumps that completely passed tapclean's inspection, after optimisation.  As this optimisation reduces wow and
    flutter and other arbitrary timing aspects, it's reasonable to assume that other people dumping the same tapes will be able to
    verify the present sides and fill in the missing ones, which are oftentimes duplicates anyway.
 * Empty commit; note
 * Actually, that last commit message is incorrect.  Identical dumps have matching magic CRC32s (payload only), but not matching
    overall CRC32s.  There's still arbitrary data in there.
 * These programs were rereleased by Hi Tec in 1989
 * ...as per the inlay cards.
 * Add full rerelease of Summer Camp
 * Add Tetris
 * Add The Greed Monster
 * Fix part names; give credit

-Don't clear the input queue on reset. (#6517) [Mike]
 * This fixes problems where devices are input line changes are missed because a device was reset. One case is at startup, where one
    device's output is wire to another's input. During start the first device adds, eg, a RESET assertion to the second. When that
    device starts, it resets itself and clears the pending RESET assertion.

-centralise instantiation of more of the util::strformat engine [Vas Crabb]

-Tidy up The Ultimate Tape Archive's dumps (#6516) [Zoë Blade]
 * Example data tidying
 * This is an example of what I'd like to do to the existing cassette dumps:
 * Conform to 8.3 filename structure, for both the software name and ROM names
 * Give credit to who dumped it, which also makes it easier to track these down
 * Optimise the image with tapclean, which changes the file's hashes (but not the payload's magic CRC32, as the target data itself
    is unaltered)
 * Optimising the image makes it overall PASS instead of FAIL.  I think this is as close as we can get to canon tape dumps.
 * Give more examples of tidying up The Ultimate Tape Archive data

-abc802: Fixed M1 opcode fetch. [Curt Coder]

-shaolins.cpp: added hardware info, corrected dips and ROM labels [Guru]

-netlist: improve performance up to 65% on audio netlists. [Couriersud]
 * This commit introduces precompiled static solver code. Due to additional optimizations the compiler can use because the detail
    calculation steps for the solution are known e.g. the kidniki netlist sees a 100% speed increase.
 * In all environments (windows/*nix/osx) the source for the static solver code can be created using bash
    src/lib/netlist/nl_create_mame_solvers.sh
 * This will create src/lib/netlist/generated/static_solvers.cpp which is compiled into the mame binary. The script is just a
    temporary workaround. The intention is that nltool whill be able to create this file with one call.
 * There are other improvements in this commit speeding up the processing of timestep and dynamic calculations.

-konamigx.cpp: fix sprite DMA transfers for type 3/4 right monitor, and fixed right screen protection in Rushing Heroes and Run &

-Make expressions octal for applicable address spaces in disassembly view [AJR]
 * Change default base from hardcoded macro to dynamic parameter for parsed_expression
 * Change symbol table parameters and variables to references or std::reference_wrapper
 * Remove the (unused) ability to construct a parsed_expression without a symbol table
 * Eliminate symbol_table &table and void *memory_param arguments from callbacks (superfluous now that std::function can bind
    everything necessary)
 * Eliminate globalref pointer from symbol_table
 * Add explicitly defaulted move constructor and move assignment operator

-am9517a: Assert EOP during rather than after final DMA transfer [AJR]
 * uPD765 may not care much about the timing of this signal, but other devices (notably NCR5380) expect it to occur simultaneously
    with the read/write strobe.
 * This *might* break drivers/devices that expect EOP to be continuously active as it was previously emulated, rather than pulsed.
    Those likely need to latch the edge of EOP or one of the ACK signals.

 * Ai Shimai - Futari no Kajitsu Doukyuusei 2 Special Disk Super Ultra Mucchin Puripuri Cyborg Maririn DX Music Pro-Towns
    (1990-05-23) Shangrlia 2 Special Disk S. A. 2
 * Promoted Music Pro-Towns to working and added usage instructions.
 * Replaced MS-DOS 6.20 L10 with the images from the Master CD, which should match the original disks. The previous images were the
    "installed" floppies that can be created from the original ones.

-ROM loading cleanup: [Vas Crabb]
 * More flexible constructors for path_iterator and emu_file
 * More straightforward system/device ROM loading and software loading when using ROM loader
 * Proper parent walk when searching for identical CHDs with different names from software list
 * Fixed hangs if software item parents form a loop
 * Fixed layouts being loaded from bogus empty paths
 * Note that there are changes in behaviour:
 * For software list ROMs/disks, MAME will now search the software path before searching the machine path
 * The search path for the owner of the software list device is used, which may not be the driver itself
 * MAME will no longer load loose CHDs from the media path - it's just too unwieldy with the number of supported systems
 * MAME will no longer search archives above the top level of the media path

-netlist: nltool usage and static compile changes. [Couriersud]
 * This commit simplifies the creation of static solvers. For this to happen the following changes were made:
 * nltool does no longer support the "-f netlist_file.cpp" option. All parts of netlist which used the option now expect the file to
    be specified after all other options. Before: nltool -t 10 -f somenetlist.cpp Now   : nltool -t 10 somenetlist.cpp
 * The static compile command now supports an "--output" option to specify the file to be created and accepts multiple input files.
    To be create the static solver file for MAME use the script provided or:
 * ./nltool --cmd static
 * -output=src/lib/netlist/generated/static_solvers.cpp src/mame/audio/nl_*.cpp src/mame/machine/nl_*.cpp
 * Updated documentation and examples provided by nltool --help

-Created softlist for Timex cassettes (timex_cass) (#6564) [ICEknigh7]
 * Created softlist for Timex cassettes (timex_cass)
 * Timex computer emulation is currently using the Spectrum softlist for cassettes, but many of those entries are actually
    incompatible unless the "Spectrum Emulator" cartridge is being used. So I've created their own compatible (depending on the
    model) softlist, with every actual Timex dump I could find in World of Spectrum and Spectrum Computing.
 * These should work with the Timex "equivalents" to the Spectrum 48K and their clones:
 * TS2068
 * UK2086
 * TC2068    (not currently emulated, or is it exactly the same as the UK2086?)
 * Komputer 2086  (not currently emulated)
 * And some of them should work with the Timex equivalents of the Spectrum 16K:
 * TC2048
 * TC2048 (NTSC)  (not currently emulated)
 * TS2048 (prototype) (not currently preserved)
 * I've noticed that many of the TZX dumps were fake ones made from TAP files (so the real pauses between blocks were lost), so I
    just added the TAPs for those while any real TZXs are created.
 * Also, there were a few bad dumps of which I could only fix one at the moment, but they seem to load in Fuse anyway so I've left
    them in the softlist, labeled as such.
 * Also included some initial notes on the cassette dumps at the beginning of it, based on the spectrum_cass softlist but more to
    the point.
 * Hooked up timex_cass to the TS2064 and TC2048
 * Now the TS2064 and TC2048 systems use both the spectrum_cass and timex_cass softlists. Also, small fixes.
 * Fixed interface types

-Created softlist for Timex cassettes (timex_cass) Timex computer emulation is currently using the Spectrum softlist for cassettes,
 but many of those entries are actually incompatible unless the "Spectrum Emulator" cartridge (which seems to be missing from the
 timex_dock softlist) is being used. So I've created their own compatible (depending on the model) softlist, with every actual Timex
 dump I could find in both World of Spectrum and Spectrum Computing. [ICEknigh7]
 * Most of these should work with the Timex "equivalents" of the Spectrum 48K and their clones:
 * TS2068
 * TC2068    (not currently emulated)
 * TC2048
 * TC2048 (NTSC)  (not currently emulated)
 * UK2086
 * I've noticed that many of the TZX dumps were fake ones made from TAP files (so the real pauses between blocks were all replaced
    with 1000ms) so I just added the TAPs in those cases, while those cassettes are being located and their real TZXs created.
 * Also, there were a few bad dumps of which I could only fix one at the moment, but they seem to load in Fuse anyway so I've left
    them in the softlist, labeled as such.
 * Also included some notes on the cassette dumps at the beginning of it, based on the spectrum_cass softlist (but with less
    clutter).
 * EDIT: Clawgrip hooked it up to the TC-2048, TS-2068 and UK-2086 systems.

-Refactoring of AVI/MNG recording code This PR is a refactoring of the AVI/MNG code, to isolate the code specific to AVI vs MNG and
 consolidate what was previously seemed to be copy and paste code.  Specifically: [npwoods]
 * 1. Code that was previously in src/emu/video.cpp pertaining to file recording is now in a new separate module
    (src/emu/recording.cpp) 2. Cut down on the duplicated logic pertaining to -snapview native handling 3. Toggling recording off
    will now turn off all recordings; previously if one had both an AVI and MNG recording, pressing Ctrl+Shift+F12 would turn off
    the AVI and leave the MNG running, and a subsequent Ctrl+Shift+F12 would do nothing
 * These changes could go further; I preserved the logic that concatenated screen indexes when creating movies when '-snapview
    native' is in effect.  This logic is not aware of file extensions and just blindly appened the index (so one could get
    foo.avi2).  A superior technique would be to do an extension aware concatenation for all screens if multiple recordings are
    made.

 made from Kryoflux dumps by Flyers80 [FakeShemp]
 * Leisure Suit Larry 2 & Pepper's Adventures in Time from Kryoflux dumps by Gypsy Dave.

-Tidy up The Ultimate Tape Archive's dumps [ZoeB]
 * Make both the software name and ROM names conform to lowercase 8.3 filename structure
 * Give credit to who dumped each software title
 * Optimise the image with tapclean, which changes the file's hashes (but not the payload's magic CRC32, as the target data itself
    is unaltered).  This makes the tape image fully pass inspection.
 * Many more to follow over the next few months, if this gets approved.

-Correct the double key assignment acceleration and shifting Put the "Gear Shift" on button 3 (SPACE key) in games where there is a
 double button assignment of accelerating and switching in the standard settings. In games like Outrun or Spy Hunter it's also set
 up like this. [MASHinfo]

new NOT WORKING ClickStart [Sean Riddle, Clawgrip, TeamEurope] + a Software List for it [Tom]
seems to be something missing, jumps to outside of code area, maybe secondary small internal ROM of CPU.  I did think the dumps were
  half size for various reasons, but there is a checksum in the footer of each one that matches the data (even if another checksum
  in the header for some of them we can't match)  Possible BIOS is wrong tho as that checksum in the footer doesn't match by quite a
  significant amount. [Tom]
most games show something just by putting a 'RET' opcode in the upper areas it attempts to jump to. [Tom]
Ryan credited in driver since it's more or less just a stripped down copy of vsmile.cpp [Tom]

WWE doesn't render any sprites other than the backgrounds once you get past the 'loading' screen [Tom]
Fantastic Four seems playable but has severe performance issues as the video code isn't optimized for scanline drawing / isn't using
  cliprect properly (runs about 10-15% speed in places) can probably be promoted once that's fixed [Tom]

ds5k133: Preliminary LANCE DMA hookup [R. Belmont]
If you can parse this comment from the Linux driver, please help :) [Tom]
The IOASIC LANCE devices use a shared memory region.  This region [Tom]
as seen from the CPU is (max) 128 kB long and has to be on an 128 kB [Tom]
boundary.  The LANCE sees this as a 64 kB long continuous memory [Tom]
region. [Tom]
[Tom]
The LANCE's DMA address is used as an index in this buffer and DMA [Tom]
takes place in bursts of eight 16-bit words which are packed into [Tom]
four 32-bit words by the IOASIC.  This leads to a strange padding: [Tom]
16 bytes of valid data followed by a 16 byte gap :-(. [Tom]
I get the first part, which is that since the DMA engine works in words and [Tom]
LANCE works in half-words that each half-word for LANCE is packed into one [Tom]
word from the CPU's point of view.  The second part not so much. [Tom]

Soft resets would reload autofire settings without saving them first, causing the settings to be lost. This commit adds a check to

  resetting. [Tom]
