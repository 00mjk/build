7855: 315_5124.cpp: Fix color in SMS1 VDP(315-5124), Add hardware notes [cam900]
color value measured from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrPrSDpp6PmHPx45LzxTVJt2uCfl0MajA8GVtpWcois/edit, 'CONSOLE 1:1' custom

8015: Allow to compile without PulseAudio [jflatt]

8016: rtc65271, firebeat: Add way to use default data for nvram initialization [987123879113]
Firebeat beatmania III and pop'n music require a password to unlock the RTC chip on a fresh installation. The only way to unlock it
  is to input a password you were supposed to get from Konami via a phone line, and more recently using a website/program I made
  (https://github.com/987123879113/firebeatrtc). Inputting the password is really inconvenient and the website isn't exactly
  advertised anywhere so it's hard for people not in the know to actually use Firebeat games. I've included RTC files that have been
  initialized as far as inputting the password with otherwise default settings.

8034: qx10: Add centronics printer port [brijohn]
Add centronics printer port to qx10 emulation.
The new sense_handler() on the centronics bus is a 5 volt signal generated on pin 35 of the centronics connector and is used to
  sense if there is a powered up device attached to the port.

8103: phoenix.cpp: Fix "G.G.I. Corporation" Phoenix set names [clawgrip]
* Fix G.G.I. name, it's "G.G.I. Corporation", not "G.G.I Corp".
* Only the set that shows Irecsa on the title screen is from (Irecsa / G.G.I. Corporation), every other G.G.I. Corporation Phoenix
  set is a generic bootleg set (we've found them on Irecsa PCBs, but also on PCBs from ASSA/Automave, Recreativos Franco and generic
  ones), so renamed the company from "Phoenix (Irecsa / G.G.I. Corporation)" to "Phoenix (G.G.I. Corporation)".
* Fix a note about "avefenix". "Electrogame" and "Video Game" are the same company (they changed its name circa 1981).
* Fix identation

Added new clone nitrobalb to rohga.cpp
Dump credits to: JammaFever, Nebula, Recreativos Piscis, Spain
Found in a Data East PCB partially assembled on Spain (by Cocamatic SL) with those particular paper labels they put in all of their
  assembled pcbs.
I had no direct access to it, but this is a picture of the actual pcb: https://i.imgur.com/9Aoc58T.jpg
It also has a Cocamatic label on the bottom-right side saying "Gun ball", but it is actually Nitroball "overseas" or world version.
It only differs in the 4 program roms placed in b3, d3, b5 and d5 from parent set.
Dip switches behave in the same way as the other two known sets.

8112: a800.xml: remove spurious Unicode code point [0kmg]
There's a U+009D following "2000" in each line. Is this somehow related to Czech character  ť  i.e. U+0165? ť is 9D in certain
  character sets and the Turbo 2000 originates there. This looks like a copy/paste error. U+009D is an invisible control char OSC,
  Operating System Command.

8121: es5503: Register E0 bits 0 and 6 are always high [tlindner]
(This is in preparation for the Ensoniq Mirage driver I will be committing soon)
In the documentation I found on the ES 5503, these bits are always returned hi. This needs to be corrected to make the ISR in the
  Mirage work correctly.
I don't know if this negatively affects the Apple ][gs. I'll be happy to do some testing, but I would need help getting setup.

8125: mac_hdflop.xml: attach the list and start adding stuff [rzero9]
This change attaches the orphan mac_hdflop.xml software list to (hopefully) all the Macintosh machines with HD floppy drives, and
  adds about 70 new software items to it.
The Mac is a bit out of my comfort zone, but rockleevk sent me some previously undumped KanjiTalk images a few months ago, and now
  that the Mac drivers fully support HD disks and all the obvious bugs have been ironed out, I thought this was a good time to add
  them along with some other things I got from WinWorld. I actually have about 60 more more waiting to be added, but as this is an
  almost-new list I wanted to submit my work so far and see if everything checks out.
A couple of notes about the naming...
- I have tried to reproduce disk labels as part_ids as closely as possible. In some cases this involves languages that are
  completely unknown to me, so I might have made some mistakes there. At the very least I know that the English, Spanish and
  Japanese labels shoud be 100% correct.
- Application names can be a bit inconsistent, so I have tried to go with what the installer or README files call them (including
  the company name if it's there, like "Microsoft PowerPoint" or "Adobe Illustrator").
- About the name of the operating system, I think Apple only started calling it "Mac OS" officially with version 7.6, so I have
  followed that convention. Also, the Korean and Japanese versions have their own regional names (HangulTalk and KanjiTalk,
  respectively), so I follow those too.
And as a side note, I know mac_flop.xml needs a lot of love too. I may start working on that when I finish sorting out the HD stuff.

8148: Updated Greek Translation [BraiNKilleRGR]

8149: wd177x: fix segfault based on track count [tlindner]
1. Remove test for head count. @cuavas was right about loading a double sided disk in a single sided drive. It doesn't segfault.
2. Add track test in check_compatibility(). generate_bitstream_from_track() will segfault if disk drive doesn't have enough tracks.

8150: fix pcap builds [xray-sky]
I was not able to build an executable with (pcap) networking enabled on macOS (11.2) until I made this change to mac_cfg.lua. I made
  the same change to the other scripts in that directory where the same condition is used.
I know nothing about Lua, though, and it's entirely possible some other part of my hours-long pounding on it was what actually made
  the difference. But I was able to repeat the results in a new branch (which I know doesn't clear out all the build stuff) with
  just this change, so I guess this was maybe it.

8168: galaxian.cpp: Started splitting up the state class [cuavas]
This is a starting-point for splitting up the “everything-bucket” state class in the “new” Galaxian driver.  It’s mostly the help
  @DavidHaywood with the impasse mentioned in #8164.
This is really just a starting point, and there’s a lot of work to do:
* There’s obviously still a huge amount of game-specific stuff in the state class
* I’m not sure whether `bagmanmc_state` and `pisces_state` are the right points to split things at – I wouldn’t be offended if that
  stuff got pushed back down into `galaxian_state`
* There’s a bunch of stuff in driver init functions that should go in machine configuration and machine start functions
* Eventually the tile extension callbacks and draw callbacks should be turned into device delegates and set from machine
  configuration

8169: pce.xml: minor updates + remove a hack [0kmg]
* make newer revision of R-Type part 2 the parent
* remove motorod2a which appears to be a 1-byte hack: it changes the 5-player input loop counter to not read input from players 3 to
  5

Fix fill value for empty ROM area

8178: Added helpers for 64-bit count leading zeroes/ones. [cuavas]
Some observations:
* On AArch64, clang is smart enough to realise that `x ? __builtin_clz(x) : 32` is equivalent to a `clz` instruction, while GCC is
  not (GCC will do a separate test and conditional move).
* On x86, neither clang nor GCC realises that the `bsr` instruction does the test for free, and both produce extra instructions to
  do the test.
* On ARM/AArch64, MSVC is terrible at generating code for anything using the `_BitScanReverse` intrinsic – it’s far better to use
  the `CountLeading…` intrinsics (which are not available on x86).
* On x86, MSVC seems to heavily favour conditional branches over conditional moves, while on ARM (really Thumb-2) it uses predicated
  moves/arithmetic.
I think I’ve covered enough cases.  I realise clang/GCC 32-bit ARM isn’t covered – the `clz` instruction is relatively new and may
  not be available, so it would be necessary to test for it, which is annoying to do.  I didn’t bother with optimised versions for
  i686 and 32-bit PowerPC, because I just don’t care enough.

8191: Atari Portfolio: Emulation fixes and improvements [jaens]
A combination of various fixes:
---
pofo: Fix RAM expander read access
This was writing the uninitialized `data` value into RAM on read
accesses, causing the external RAM checks to fail. Probably a typo, fix.
---
pofo: Magic port 0x61 emulation
This is used by various utility programs (such as `ram_test.com` and
`lcd_test.com`) to identify if the program is running on a Pofo.
Apparently 0x61 is the Pofo developers favorite magic value, since the
Pofo-specific services' interrupt number is also 0x61.
---
pofo: Fix external drive B: detection
(see added comment in code)
---
pofo: Better control register 0x8051 emulation
(see added comment in code)

8192: pofo: Create real keyboard device [jaens]
The current implementation had a severe flaw - it did not properly
support multiple keys being pressed down at the same time, but only
registered the key that was the "first" in the scan matrix.
This lead to being unable to type certain capital letters, some
shortcuts not working etc.
Fix this by creating a real keyboard device based on the common
`device_matrix_keyboard_interface` class.

8194: End the big-endian block in the right place [pkubaj]

8196: taitosj - add a postload so that savestates work [DavidHaywood]

8198: c64_cass.xml - updated year and publisher details [scoomby]
Reviewed c64_cass.xml and noticed a number of release years were inconsistent, missing or incorrect, and a few of the publisher
  details were also incorrect.
During the 80's and 90' there were a number of budget labels that had been created by some publishers to release games at a
  discounted price.  Sometimes these games were re-releases of games previously published by the same company at full price.
Notable budget labels are as follows:
Firebird Silver (Firebird) - A mix of original and re-releases.
Silverbird (previously Firebird Silver) - A mix of original releases and re-releases.
Ricochet (Mastertronic) - All re-releases.
The Hit Squad (Ocean & U.S. Gold) - All re-releases and compilations.
Encore (Elite Systems) - Mostly re-releases.
Kixx (U.S. Gold) - All re-releases.
Summit (Alternative Software) - A mix of original releases and re-releases.
GBH (Gremlin Graphics) - All re-releases.
Sparklers (Creative Sparks) - All re-releases.
In some cases, a re-release wasn't identical to the original release where tape loaders, loading screens, or title screens had been
  changed.  There also a couple of cases where the game has been modified in the re-release (e.g. Cauldron's difficulty level was
  lowered).
Presently, there are a lot of the C64 tape files are dumped from the budget label release.  To keep things consistent, the release
  year reflects the year of the original release or the year of the budget re-release as applicable.  Publisher details reflects the
  original release publisher, budget label or distributor as applicable.
Questions, suggestions and comments are very welcome.

8210: Eliminate remaining uses of auto_alloc and friends [aaronsgiles]
This PR removes auto_alloc and related definitions, as well as removing the resource_pool from running_machine. In general the fixes
  should generally be pretty straightforward. Some notes:
* In a number of cases, memory was allocated and assigned to a pointer, which could later be overridden, so for those cases I
  generally allocated a separate buffer and assigned the pointer to it at start.
* For a couple of drivers I was familiar with I tried to do a little more extensive cleanup.
* The polylgcy stuff isn't pretty, but will be jettisoned when the new voodoo code is ready.

8211: Allow saved states to be deleted from the internal UI. [cuavas]
This post on r/MAME asked about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/MAME/comments/o53l6z/does_anyone_knows_how_to_delete_a_save_state_from/
There currently isn’t a way to do it, but this implements it with relatively low impact.  You’re prompted to confirm you really want
  to delete.  If you do, it removes the file directly (it doesn’t get get put in the Recycle Bin or similar), so no backsies.
Any objections to this?

8212: rework system18 Alien Storm bootlegs, put in their own driver to study [DavidHaywood]
this at least renders the backgrounds using the very strange 'tile strip' logic the bootleg hardware appears to implement as a

8213: Eliminate reacharound calls to fetch the maincpu in the SNES CX4 [aaronsgiles]
It was already passing the machine around everywhere, for no reason other than to fetch the maincpu. Instead just pass the
  address_space, which is really all it needs in the end anyway.

8214: Fixed conflicting softlist entries in SGI softlists. [MooglyGuy]
-sgi_mips_hdd: Added _hdd suffix to entries to prevent conflicts with CD-ROM entries when both are present. [Ryan Holtz]

8215: imgtool: Remove object pool usage [aaronsgiles]
Object/resource pool usage was almost gone from imgtool. This PR removes the remainder. Specifically:
* The image class doesn't allocate extra_data for the module; rather, the module allocates it on its own
* Several strings are now represented as std::string in the module structure (which can no longer be cleared by memset)
* The image::malloc() function has been removed; it was only used in one place, for the OS9 bitmap allocation. Since the maximum
  bitmap size is only 64k, to avoid deeper changes I just changed it to a fixed size 64k array so that the malloc is no longer
  needed.
With this PR, and the next one to remove usage from flopimg, we should be able to remove the very legacy src\lib\util\pool.* code
  altogether.

8216: flopimg: Remove pool usage [aaronsgiles]
Object/resource pool usage was almost gone from flopimg. This PR removes the remainder. Specifically:
* The track data and tag data are now held by std::unique_ptr
* The floppy_image_legacy struct is now allocated/freed with new/delete, and no longer memset
With this PR, and the previous one to remove usage from imgtool, we should be able to remove the very legacy src\lib\util\pool.*
  code altogether.

-machine/latch8.cpp: Clean up a little. [Vas Crabb]
 * Making the bit read functions honour the XOR mask is easy in theory, but dkong.cpp is doing scary things with the XOR mask and
    bit read handlers on one of its latches, so it could end up breaking something.  Honouring the read callbacks would add two
    tests to each of the bit read functions, which could hurt performance.  The whole design of this device seems somewhat
    incoherent.
