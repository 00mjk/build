-unkitpkr: Add switch to disable card graphics in bookkeeping mode [AJR]

-Restrict ROM labels to a filesystem- and shell-safe subset of printable ASCII. [Vas Crabb]
 * This has not been done unilaterally - I have the support of @galibert, @Tafoid, and @rb6502 to do something about the current
    free-for-all.
 * The trouble with the ROM label field in MAME is that it serves multiple competing purposes: it's supposed to identify the device
    in the original system, and also act as a filename when searching for media image files to load.  It also has to appear in
    listings of needed/missing files (e.g. in cases where the image _isn't_ found).
 * To identify the original device, the ROM label field in MAME often contains text derived from some combination of one or more of
    the text on a label if present, the silkscreen on an IC package, the location on the circuit board, and the device designation.
    There's no standard for the order in which these appear and how they're separated.  Some people add arbitrary filename
    extensions and other annotations.
 * There are practical limitations on what can appear in the string, given it's used as a filename:
 * Path/name length limits.
 * Restrictions on characters that can appear in a filename.
 * Practicality of using the filename in a command-line environment.
 * Ambiguity when describing a filename.
 * Filesystems themselves typically restrict characters in filenames:
 * Windows defines MAX_PATH as 260 characters - longer paths are difficult to use with Win32 APIs and don't work properly in Windows
    Explorer
 * Most filesystems don't allow ^@ or the path separator in names.
 * Windows doesn't allow C0 control characters or <>:"/\|?* characters in filenames.
 * Filesystems may have collation, e.g. FAT16 is case-folding, NTFS and HFS+ are case-preserving but case-insensitive, while EXT and
    XFS are case-sensitive.
 * Filesystems may perform Unicode normalisation, e.g. NTFS forces NFC, HFS+ forces NFD, while ZFS stores filenames as supplied at
    creation, but may be configured to apply normalisation when testing equality.
 * Shells use various ASCII characters for special purposes:
 * C0 control characters for line editing and control (e.g. ^C to cancel a line, ^V for control charecter escape, ^R for history
    search).
 * The "'\ chracaters for quoting/escaping.
 * The ><| characters for redirection.
 * The *?[] characters for pattern matching.
 * The ${}~ characters for variable substitution/sequence expansion.
 * The ! or ^ characters for history substitution.
 * The ()` characters for controlling subshells.
 * The %& characters for job control.
 * The ; character as a command separator.
 * The # character for comments.
 * There's also the issue of whether users across a range of locales will be able to type/display characters.  We still don't have
    good support for Unicode console output on Windows (std::wcout doesn't seem to work properly), many users don't install C/J/K
    fonts, and many users aren't comfortable entering text in unfamiliar languages.  This means we're limited to printable ASCII for
    practical purposes.
 * The practical limitations mean the subset of "safe" characters is limited to ASCII digits, either uppercase or lowercase English
    Latin (but not both due to collation behaving differently across systems), and the +,-.=_ punctuation chracters.  We've decided
    on lowercase, digits, and safe punctuation.  In addition to this, spaces are allowed, as they can be quoted/escaped easily
    enough if no other special characters are used.
 * There have been some arguments that allowing uppercase is "more accurate", but in practical terms it doesn't add much value.  A
    string in a C++ program can't represent layout, relative size of text, colour and shape of the label, text font, graphics, and
    many other details.  It also does nothing to address labels with text outside the English Latin alphabet (e.g. labels with
    Chinese ideographs).  Besides missing information, the lack of hard and fast rules means you need to intuit what a label string
    in MAME is trying to represent.  There is simply no substitute for photographs.  There wasn't even any consistency in case
    within individual machine sets.  For example, several games in vigilant.cpp had inconsistent case for "ic" vs "IC" in
    designation suffixes, and ibm6850.cpp had inconsistent case for filename extensions withing a set.  There were sets that used
    uppercase for text from the label but not from the part number/PCB location, and vice versa.  It was a huge mess.
 * There's some merit to the idea of allowing a wider variety of characters in the label strings in the source, and mapping to a
    more restricted set when searching for files.  However it creates more issues than it solves.  It would require a change to the
    XML output to provide both the label and filename, and a corresponding change to external ROM management tools.  It would be
    impractical to do for software lists, because it would require ROM management tools to implement the exact same mapping
    algorithm as MAME.
 * But that aside, actually doing useful mapping would be impractical. What would you do with C/J/K ideographs, like the chip
    labelled 東方不敗 (Dongfang Bubai)?  There's no intuitive way to do the mapping wtihout incluing something like Unihan data, which
    would add a lot of bloat.  Even the, without a language hint the Romanisation would be less than ideal in many cases (using
    Chinese reading for Japanese text and vice versa).  There's still the messy issue of filesystem collation to deal with.
 * We do allow full Unicode in comments in the source.  If you want to provide a more detailed description of a ROM label, that's
    the place for it.  You've got more characters available, and the possibility of using mulitple lines.  There are too many other
    competing requirements on the label field in the ROM definitions.

-use a handcrafted c-chip rom for Rainbow Islands Extra, pending a real dump, allows removal of simulation code and general
 cleanups. (#3338) [David Haywood]
 * also made rainbow islands extra a parent, since it has it's own game code, own c-chip and is generally considered a semi-sequel
    rather than a bugfix / revision of the original game.
 * (best I can tell behavior matches the differences between original and extra that were present in the simulation at least, but
    obviously the real chip could be hiding more secrets)

-IEEE-488 remotizer device Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR adds the IEEE-488 "remotizer" device. The main purpose of this device is to connect an emulated IEEE-488 bus with
    external devices. A bi-directional bitbanger stream act as interface (to be of any use bitbanger should be connected to a socket
    or pipe). By the way, does anyone of you know a simple way to assign a name to bitbangers which is not "bitb<number>" ?
    Currently it's not easy to tell which bitbanger does what by looking at its name (for example: we have bitb1, bitb2 & bitb3 on
    hp9845 with remotizer).
 * I'm going to release soon in a separate repository a proof-of-concept tool for HLE of HP9895 floppy drive. This tool is truly
    crude but it can read & write disk images through the remotizer. It has been tested on HP9845B & HP85 emulators. Over time it
    should evolve in something able to emulate a set of different HP drives.
 * Thanks.
