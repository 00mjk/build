-thayers: Fixed keyboard scanning. [Curt Coder]

-Fix warning about non existing memory space when netlist is used ... [couriersud]

-Reduce overhead to load data (roms) in netlist significantly. [couriersud]
 * The previous solution involved a significant amount of redundant replication of information and objects. Now, a rom name
    specified as
 * SOMEROM(x21, "romlabel")
 * will automatically be loaded from region "netlisttag:romlabel". Examples are hazl1500 and stuntcyc. [Couriersud]

-Logging enhancement for Joakim. [couriersud]
 * For netlist device debugging one can now use #define LOG(...) log().info(__VA_ARGS__) to use debugging and the known #define
    LOG(...) do {} while (0) do disable debugging on device level.
 * To avoid bitrot one could as well use #define LOG(...) log().info.log<true>(__VA_ARGS__) and #define LOG(...)
    log().info.log<false>(__VA_ARGS__)
 * The later disables debugging. If the compiler can assume that there are no side effects from e.g. using foo(a/b), 'LOG("abc
    {1:04x}", foo(a/b));' should be completely optimized away.
 * Log channels available are info, verbose, warning, error and fatal. Don't use debug, it is enabled only on specific debug builds.
 * Use would be e.g. LOG("abc {1:04x}", 2); The format specifier in the string are enclosed in "{}". "{2}" is the second parameter
    after the format string. Types are determined automatically. "{3:04x}" would format a number as a hexadecimal with 4 leading
    zeros.
 * [Couriersud]

-Cut down on the missing PC booter list: [Justin Kerk]

-vmetal: Sound improvements [AJR]
 * Implement IRQ used to loop ES-8712 music (much like gcpinbal). All extant samples should be playable now.
 * Reduce unreasonably high OKIM6295 volume.
 * MACHINE_IMPERFECT_SOUND flag removed.
 * Add a reset line callback for the ES-8712. This will be used to reset the MSM5205/MSM6585 when the implementation is rewritten to
    use those devices. For now, it's used for IRQ generation in vmetal, whose program seems to use a separate gate to prevent
    unwanted IRQs when the device is reset. (gcpinbal appears to do the same with a rather subtle difference.)
 * Removed the probably bogus and already unused auto-repeat feature from the ES-8712 device. All known games that loop samples do
    so by status polling or IRQs.

-naomi.cpp: redumped "Crackin' DJ Part 2" [billy16jr, Cereth, cpsystem3, MetalliC, rtw]

-arm7/pgm2 improvements Add support for the second BLX form for ARMv5, and fix behavior of second BLX form in THUMB. [trap15]
 * Then I fixed the address map for PGM2 up a little bit and added some notes.
 * Hopefully this'll help jump-start PGM2 work, since nobody has to fuss with CPU cores now :)

    Crisis)
 * byte swap sample ROMs for adillor and primglex.

-hp9845: implemented correct aspect of alpha & graphic video modes Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR implements the correct aspect ratios of text & graphic modes of HP9845B and their relative sizes on the screen. See my
    post about this: MAME forum Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-LIST command format changes The intent of this commit is twofold. [Tafoid]
 * First intent was to fix up the output produced by many LIST commands so that can be parsed correctly and accurately by front-ends
    and other tools, attempting to future-proof the format a bit to cover maximum string sizes expected.
 * Secondly, I also included a fix for very large file sizes in which "int" was no longer able to handle.  This explicitly affects
    hapyfsh2 at this time and should cover use

-VME bus: added default bus address space and prepared for bus specific features [JoakimLarsson]
 * The VME bus interface now allocate its own  memory space default. This can be turned off in the case of computers with an
    internal VME bus, performance reasons or if there is no risk of more complicated use cases involving address modifiers or need
    for daisy chaining of VME bus signals. The slot naming is now hidden and replaced by a slot number in the MCFG interface in
    order to be used for daisy chaining and also to warn about real estate problems.

-intvkbd - mostly internal driver improvements WIP - commit.  Not much visible progress yet, except that the screen alignment is now
 correct.  But internally things are getting better.  Rebased on top of mame0182 [palazzol]
 * Changed intvkbd to use generic TMS9927 support Modded TMS9927 to allow for driver-specific overscan areas Aligned STIC and
    TMS9927 graphics properly Added prelim support for testing intvkbd printer Add proper documented memory addresses for tape drive
    Bring in commented tape drive code from old MESS source (wip)

-Updates FSF address in a few files. Very minor pull request, this just updates the FSF address in the license header of a few
 shaders. [Luke-Nukem]

-ms7004 keyboard: handle incoming serial data via INT pin. [shattered]

-gcpinbal: Modernization and sound improvements [ajrhacker]
 * Break up the bogus IOC structure and use 8-bit handlers where appropriate. This fixes a music playback glitch due to the old
    handler's failure to take byte mirroring into account.
 * Improve OKI M6295 sounds by using correct bit for banking

-Fixed Battle Cruiser M-12 sprite colors The ship hull is red and not grey See here
 http://www.andysarcade.net/store2/video-arcade-game-items/non-jamma-pcbs/battle-cruiser-m12.html and
 http://www.flyerfever.com/post/156753129608/battle-cruiser-m-12 http://www.arcade-museum.com/images/112/1122093152.jpg [MASHinfo]

-Bug fix for HP9895 Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR fixes a couple of problems with HP9895 disk drive emulation. As far as I can tell the emulation behaves as it should now.
    It previously had an issue with IEEE488 interface and one with AM synchronization. Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-Force CPU-20 Added board variant handling and a few variants [JoakimLarsson]

-Via6522 fixes A couple of fixes to the VIA6522 shift register as we've scrutinized the datasheet. There are still details not
 emulated perfectly but at least we haev a 50/50 duty cycle now required to interact with a netlist device and we try to do things
 on the right flank. There is also a fix for spurious timer events that occured when changing shifter mode between internal and
 external clock. This is abused by the mac128k rom set for instance, see attached regression test logs for details. I am still
 curious what Tafoid will find if anything :) via6255regressions.txt [JoakimLarsson]

-Correctly assign service buttons Mame Testers Bug: http://mametesters.org/view.php?id=6470 [OzFalcon]

-A few fixes and more documentation for Heathkit H19 and H89. [mgarlanger]

-Fix issues on 32-bit builds and clamp latency Fixes a critical bug that causes segfaults. Only seems to affect the 32-bit builds,
 but might affect 64-bit builds as well. [intealls]

-gcpinbal: Add HCT157 [ajrhacker]

-HP9895 floppy drive Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR is for my emulator of HP9895A dual floppy disk drive. I think that, as far the drive emulator is concerned, it's done.
    The next step will be the support for a disk image format. At the moment it only supports the MFI format. I'm attaching an image
    for a completely empty & unformatted DSDD disk if you want to try it.
 * The system should be started with the following command line to enable the 9895 emulator. ``` hp9845b -slot0 98034_hpib
    -slot0:98034_hpib:ieee_dev hp9895 -optrom1 massd -flop1 test9895_virgo.mfi ``` This command line sets this chain up:
    HP9845B<->98034 module<->HPIB bus<->HP9895 and loads the blank image in the 1st drive. The defaults are as follows: 98034 select
    code = 7 98034 HPIB address = 21 98034 is HPIB system controller 9895 HPIB address = 0
 * Once 9845 has started, you could try formatting the disk & getting its (empty) directory afterward. ``` INITIALIZE ":H7",2 CAT
    ":H7" ```
 * "H7" is the "address" of the 1st floppy. Keep in mind that the format command ("INITIALIZE") needs more than 8 minutes (!!) to
    complete. HP people were a bit paranoid back then because disk is formatted & verified 5 times with different data patterns
    during initialization!
 * Don't get alarmed, please, when you see I changed the fdc_pll files. I needed to split a couple of functions in 2 parts. All the
    former users of its interface will see absolutely no change.
 * Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi
 * test9895_virgo.zip

-sbuk2 is confirmed as a bad dump, added date to topbana [Heihachi_73]

-polyplay: lightorgan + optional layout [SailorSat]
 * finaly traced the light logic on the board
 * added an optional layout (very basic)

-Fixed building using system portaudio [belegdol]

-added aristmk5 set that was missed last time (pantmaga) [Heihachi_73] also moved the GAME definitions for the known bad dumps to
 their own section for easier reference if somebody wants to track those specific versions down for redumping [ghost]

-Fixed building using system utf8proc [belegdol]

-fix clipper cpu build. include limits.h that provides INT_MIN and INT_MAX [felipesanches]

-preliminary TLCS-870 disassembler - Work in Progress based on tlcs-90 core structure, very preliminary, just decodes the
 instructions and gives a disassembly for now, still need to do a lot of cleanup and add execution + peripherals. [ghost]
 * doesn't need merging yet, putting here to keep track of progress.
