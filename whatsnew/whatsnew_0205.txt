 notes saturn.cpp, stv.cpp : Correct SCSP clock, Add notes stvcd.cpp : Add device_mixer_interface related to SCSP EXTS [cam900]

-New driver : HP 3478A Digital Multimeter (#4342) [fenugrec]
 * Added new driver: HP 3478A Multimeter
 * WIP, machine not working, skeleton, highly incomplete. Compiles, that's about all.
 * hp3478a: implement ROM banking
 * code runs "properly" at least to the CAL RAM check (fails, RAM not implemented)
 * hp3478a: some IO work
 * Interpret CS lines for external accesses (GPIB, CAL RAM, DIP switches). Also, remove MCFG_ stuff Also, use logmacro.h stuff
 * hp3478a: partial emulation of LCD
 * The main CPU has a serial link to the LCD module. This WIP splits commands and data mostly successfully (still some bogus
    shifting which would be fairly easy to ignore). None of the commands are implemented yet, and no actual display is generated
    yet.
 * Includes unrelated tweak : only change bank when the A12 line changes.
 * hp3478a: added LCD rendering !
 * code shamelessly stolen from tranz330 and roc10937 drivers. Not clickable yet.
 * hp3478a: implement CAL NVRAM
 * Finally. IO mapping has provisions for the DIP switches as well as i8291 GPIB interface registers.
 * hp3478a: improve LCD rendering
 * Remove some artifacts: with the LCD "not selected", some data is sent on IWA (probably to purge a shift register ?) but was
    parsed with the last m_lcdiwa state. Reset this everytime PWO is deselected.
 * Also parse decimal point, comma and "all segments".
 * hp3478a: implement keypad
 * hp3478a: CAL switch to write-protect NVRAM
 * hp3478a: implement DIP switches
 * hp3478a: fix self-test reset freeze (missing WDT)
 * There is an external WDT counter that is periodically reset by the CPU in normal operation. When forcing a reset from the front
    panel, this counter is allowed to overflow (20th bit, clocked at Xtal / 15), giving a reset time of about 1.3s.

-hp3478a: minor code style fixes (#4351) [fenugrec]
 * removed unused #define VFD_TAG
 * moved .h contents to hp3478a.cpp
 * prefix all vars with m_
 * remove C-style static funcs

 Recreativas.org] (#4350) [ClawGrip]
 * balsente.cpp: Improved the documentation about the Spanish Trivial sets and added a missing PAL for the Bally/Sente PCB
    [ClawGrip, Recreativas.org]

    remove it for now.

-tms32031.cpp: Fixed the disassembler. [Ryan Holtz]

-scsp.cpp : Minor updates Code style fixes, Correct SSCTL, Initial RBL, Add notes, Cleanup unused / duplicates [cam900]

-m68kfpu: add (d16,An) addr mode to WRITE_EA_FPE() [Sven Schnelle]
 * required by netbsd ps command, which utilizes the FPU.

-new NOT WORKING --  Pro Tele Cardioline (Salter Fitness Bike V.1.0, Checksum 02AB)
 [ClawGrip, Roberto Fresca, Arcade Vintage, Recreativas.org]
 * (this is a starting point, it shows the boot screen, probably want s a signal / input from something to continue)

-sound/scsp.cpp - Fix compilation on OSX Clang [Klez]
 * Changes decrement operation from "=-"  to "-="
 * Error: ../../../../../src/devices/sound/scsp.cpp:1549:6: error: use of unary operator that may be intended as compound assignment
    (-=) [-Werror] p =- 128; ^~ ../../../../../src/devices/sound/scsp.cpp:1585:9: error: use of unary operator that may be intended

-[Rainbow-100]: correct palette problems and silence log output (#4373) [Bavarese]
 * Correct palette problems and silence log output
 * Monitor autodetection avoids false colors [on a real machine, this would require rewiring]. Corrected palette problems

 * Old_palette removed
 * More fixes that slipped through (NW)
 * Update rainbow.cpp
 * Update rainbow.cpp

-Rulechan.cpp big cleanup... [Roberto Fresca]

-gsword: Preliminary MCU emulation. [Vas Crabb, Caps0ff, *=/STARRIDER\=*]
 * Removed BAD_DUMP flag from josvolly MCU dump - there's no reason to believe the MCUs contain different programs, and Allumer were
    known to use different silkscreen on identical parts (would still be nice to get confirmation).
 * Connected gsword MCUs and correted connections for DIP switches, player inputs, start buttons, coin chutes, and coin counters.
 * Lots of guesses due to lack of measurements, schematics, or even good PCB pictures.
 * Demoted gsword to MACHINE_NOT_WORKING and MACHINE_IMPERFECT_SOUND as there are issues with credits registering and sound.

    falls outside of what funcube2 expects

-sdl_sound.cpp: Rework the circular buffer [Celelibi]
 * Previous code had several oddities. Like checks against buffer overflows / underflows done at several places in the code, usage
    of a spinlock, unnecessary use of "volatile" qualifier, redundant informations about the circular buffer and exposed details
    about the split nature of ranges in the buffer. This lead to an unlikely deadlock once in a great while.

-New WORKING clone (#4408) [ClawGrip]
 * New WORKING clone
   - ---------------------- Galaxy Gunners (set 1) [David Torres, ClawGrip, Recreativas.org]
 * Also documented the CPUs to be 8088 (main) and V20 (sound) and corrected the sound clock (7.9955 instead of 8MHz).
 * Out of whatsnew: It sounds good to me, but I left MACHINE_IMPERFECT_SOUND on. I'll record the real sounds from the PCB on a few
    days to compare.
 * Also, leave the original set as parent.

-add SFR register names for axc51 disassemler (#4405) [David Haywood]
 * add SFR register names for axc51 disassemler

-eepromser: Serial EEPROMs don't actually have reset lines, so remove the device_reset handler that automatically switches back to
 STATE_IN_RESET at machine reset time [AJR]
 * This change might cause erratic behavior in some systems which should be deasserting CS by clearing their EEPROM latches on
    reset, but is more appropriate for some MCU-based systems which actually depend on CS being automatically asserted through
    pull-ups when their quasi-bidirectional ports are reset.

-Nascom 2/3: Fixed keyboard operation so CTRL key combinations work correctly. Added correct NAS-SYS3 bioses for default, AVC and
 NAS-NET versions. Added additional CP/M Bioses. [prime6809]
 * - Phill Harvey-Smith.

-leapster.xml: Document some undumped games (there are dozens still missing) [clawgrip]

-basic Monon Color skeleton + Software List [zhongtiao1] first pass [DavidHaywood]
 * note, software list names need romanizing so that shortnames can be properly assigned, would appreciate some help with that.

-Fix compilation errors with -Og When compiling with the option `-Og` (or with the make option `OPTIMIZE=g`), g++ emit an error
 about some variables that may be used uninitializes. It appear that with `-Og`, GCC's static analyzer falls into that spot where it
 is smart enough to detect that the variable is conditionally initialized, but not smart enough to realize it is only used when
 initialized. [Celelibi]

-sdl_sound.cpp: Rework the circular buffer Fix #4381 I made the circular buffer a separate class to isolate the handling of the
 buffer from the handling of the sound stuff. [Celelibi]
 * There is no more spinlock, therefore no risk of deadlock. The buffer overflow / underflow conditions are handled only once and
    acted upon immediately instead of risking a race condition.
 * One thing to notice is that now the attenuation is performed in the `sdl_callback` function instead of doing it at the time of
    insertion into the buffer. It is also made as a separate pass onto the data chunk. But I doubt this could have any significant
    impact on the performance.

-seta2.cpp: checkpoint trying to make use of x offset registers etc. [DavidHaywood]
 * causes a single pixel offset in some cases (funcube3) but I think as I add more register use that will vanish too so doesn't
    really worry me at this stage.
 * also adjusted the coin timing because funcube2 wasn't happy with the default, and removed the h8 patches, which best I can tell
    aren't needed here (even if you can't remove basically the same patches in subsino2.cpp without breaking coins there)
 * also actually marked the star audition sound rom as bad, there's a comment saying it's bad, the sound in MAME is awful (plays
    wrong instruments for everything) but it wasn't actually marked as such.

-Allow clang for FreeBSD and NetBSD. [0-wiz-0]

-seta2.cpp: use special bit (maybe legacy mode / fixed config bit?) for grdians map screen overlay [DavidHaywood]

-Include cmath header for atan in std:: This fixes a compilation problem on NetBSD where the compiler was complaining that atan is

-HP98x5: refactored I/O sub-system & added HP98032 GPIO module. Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR is for a set of changes to HP9825 & HP9845 emulation. In summary:
 * I refactored the HP9845 I/O sub-system to an external device (hp98x5_io_sys_device) to share its code with HP9825,
 * I added the I/O slots to HP9825
 * I implemented the HP98032 GPIO module.
 * Next step, when time allows, will be the implementation of HLE of HP9885 8" floppy drive. In the real hw it connects to the
    system through the 98032 module. Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

This adds a driver for the HP 3478A DMM. Those units are reasonably well documented with full service manual and schematics.
  Additionally, I have published my annotated disassembly of a common firmware dump in another repo. [fenugrec]
Emulation is subjectively ~ 80% complete and mostly accurate. It's going to be simpler listing what isn't implemented, or broken:
  [fenugrec]
Analog-side CPU (8048), never dumped (to my knowledge). Its presence can be faked to some extent by patching a handful of bytes in
  the stock ROM. [fenugrec]
i8291 HP-IB (IEEE488) interface [fenugrec]
LCD "annunciators" not rendered [fenugrec]
LCD charset has 3 unverified characters (flagged in the source code). [fenugrec]
I don't plan on adding major features to this driver, but I hope I've commented and written the code in such a way that the "door is
  open" should someone be interested. [fenugrec]
As it stands I've rebased on the latest head but I can squash / rebase as required. [fenugrec]
